        <h3>Figuring Out What You Care About</h3>
<p>Knowing <a href=“https://tinybuddha.com/blog/determine-what-will-make-you-happy-by-identifying-your-values/” target="_blank">what you value</a> is fundamental to constructing a fulfilling life and career. Your values are what you judge to be important in all aspects of life.</p> 
 
<p>You can start by making a list of your top ten values (if you need inspiration, you can use this <a href=“http://www.mas.org.uk/quest/ivp2.htm” target="_blank">questionnaire</a>). Next, carefully review your top ten values and narrow that list to your top five. Once you’ve identified your core values, let people in your social and professional networks know what they are. Then they can connect you with resources, people, and opportunities that align with your values and interests.</p> 
 
<p>Being able to talk about your values can <a href=“http://www.mas.org.uk/quest/ivp2.htm” target="_blank">help you land a job</a>, or help you write a personal statement for a scholarship application or graduate school. Use your values to describe what motivates you and influences who you are and what you’ve done. It’s easy to talk about what you’ve experienced, but being able to articulate what you’ve learned from your experiences – including how they shaped your values – can set you apart from other applicants.</p>
