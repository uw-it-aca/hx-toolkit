        <p>Your online presence should match who you are in real life. How you present yourself – and to whom – can make a difference. Email messages to faculty, mentors, and potential employers should be brief and professional.</p>
<p>Here are some tips that will help you make a good impression:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include a useful subject line</strong> – A title like “meeting” will not be helpful for people who receive dozens of emails per day.</li>
<li><strong>Use a greeting at the beginning</strong> – You can’t go wrong with “Hello” or “Dear [their name].” Default to a formal title (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Dr.) unless you are already on a first-name basis.</li>
<li><strong>AVOID ALL CAPS!</strong> – Unless you really are intending to shout&#8230;.</li>
<li><strong>Double-check attachments</strong> – Are they attached? Are they titled appropriately?</li> 
<li><strong>Develop an email signature</strong> – Use something that includes more information about you, such as a link to your online profile or portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking time to present yourself and communicate carefully will help you make good first impressions, both online and in person.</p>
