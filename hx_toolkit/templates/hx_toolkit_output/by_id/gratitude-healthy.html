        <h3>Feel Good </h3>


<p>
Sarah Kopelovich, UW Medicine faculty member, <a href="https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/mind/well-being/5-surprising-health-benefits-gratitude">published a study on gratitude</a> that showed that expressing gratitude improves your health, helps with better sleep, and contributes to an overall positive feeling of well-being. It can also help with stress reduction and make you feel more satisfied with your life!

<h3 id="practice-gratitude">Practice Gratitude</h3>


<p>
It does take some effort to be regularly thankful. <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/ten_ways_to_become_more_grateful1/">Robert Emmons</a>, gratitude researcher, has lots of tips, including: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Keep a gratitude journal</strong>. Write down something you are thankful for every day.

<li><strong>Remember the bad</strong>. Sometimes it can be helpful to think about things you have overcome.

<li><strong>Use visual reminders</strong>. Good habits are hard to start but using an item (a gift from a friend or a photo of someone special) to prompt gratitude can help.

<li><strong>Go through the motions</strong>. Acting as if you are grateful (smiling, saying thank you, writing a note of gratitude) can often trigger the emotion of gratitude and a feeling of wellbeing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try gratitude for a week and see how it impacts you. If it works, you can make it a <em>thankful</em> habit.
