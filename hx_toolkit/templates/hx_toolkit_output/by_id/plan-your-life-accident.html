        <p>Sometimes you intend to have an experience, like an internship in your field of interest. Other times, there's "just what happened" – like when your internship doesn't pan out and a friend ropes you into volunteering for Alternative Spring Break, or someone nominates you to be on a panel talking about your undergrad research project. </p>


<h3>Mining for Insights</h3>
<p>How do you make the most of these "accidental" experiences? Mine them for information about what does – and does not – engage you. Did the experience bring you joy? Did it sap your energy or fire you up? To get more detailed insights, try the “AEIOU” method.</p>

<p>Here’s how Bill Burnett and Dave Evans describe the method in their book, “Designing Your Life”:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Activities</strong> – What were you actually doing? Was this a structured or unstructured activity? Did you have a specific role to play (team leader) or were you just a participant (at a meeting)?</li>
<li><strong>Environments</strong> – Our environment has a profound effect on our emotional state. You feel one way at a football stadium, another in a cathedral. Notice where you were when you were involved in the activity. What kind of place was it, and how did it make you feel?</li>
<li><strong>Interactions</strong> – What were you interacting with–people or machines? Was it a new kind of interaction or one you are familiar with? Was it formal or informal?</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong> – Were you interacting with any objects or devices–iPads or smartphones, hockey sticks or sailboats? What were the objects that created or supported your feeling engaged?</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> – Who else was there and what role did they play in making it either a positive or negative experience?</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Benefits</h3>
<p>When you’re able to identify specifically what makes an experience delightful or dull, you can wisely choose a next experience, and you’re on your way to designing a fulfilling and happy life.</p>
