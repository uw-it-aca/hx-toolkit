        <p>Creating your Husky Experience is an opportunity unique to you, but you don’t have to start from scratch or go it alone. We are a team of UW staff members who spent time collecting suggestions – from students, faculty, and other staff – on how to help all students successfully create the kind of Husky Experience that will serve them well.</p>

<p>The Husky Experience Toolkit is a collection of suggestions to help you challenge yourself, think about options, and weave together all you are learning. They are being delivered via MyUW so that all students have access to these ideas and resources. Learn more in this <a href="https://vimeo.com/262608056/7bc7f718a8">1 min video about the Husky Experience Toolkit</a>.
