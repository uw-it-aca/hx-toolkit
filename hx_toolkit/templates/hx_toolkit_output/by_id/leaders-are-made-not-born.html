        <h3>Cultivating Leadership</h3>
<p><strong>Research shows that over 70% of leadership skills are learned, not innate. That means that every person can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to be an effective change agent and contribute to their communities.</strong> That’s the role of the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/huskyleadership/">Husky Leadership Initiative (HLI)</a>: to help students cultivate these capacities.</p> 

<p>The work of HLI is guided in part by two main ideas:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Leadership grows out of experience, practice, and reflection.</li>
<li>Leadership is not about position; everyone can engage in leadership.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Discovering the ways <em>you</em> like to lead is the trick to unlocking your potential. Check out HLI’s <a href="http://www.washington.edu/huskyleadership/resources/leadership-commons/" >list of opportunities</a> across the UW to learn and practice leadership– see if any of them appeal to you.</p>

<h3>What are Your Leadership Capacities?</h3>
<p>One way to reflect on your development as a leader, or to identify the ways you’re most comfortable exercising leadership, is through understanding different leadership capacities. Students who enroll in the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/huskyleadership/programs/leadership-certificate/" >Husky Leadership Certificate</a> program use these capacities to formally reflect on their experiences, but you can do this on your own as well. The capacities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning and Reasoning</li>
<li>Self Awareness and Development</li>
<li>Interpersonal Interaction</li>
<li>Group Dynamics</li>
<li>Civic Responsibility</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Strategic Planning</li>
<li>Personal Behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed descriptions of these capacities are included in HLI’s <a href="http://huskyleadership.uw.edu/about/learning-objectives-2/">Leadership Framework</a>. Ask yourself: What are my strengths? Where have I demonstrated these capacities in the past? In what areas would I like to grow? You can also check out the <a href="https://huskyleadership.uw.edu/programs/leadership-certificate/student-e-portfolio-gallery/">leadership portfolios</a> of other UW students and think about the ways in which cultivating leadership allows you to turn your knowledge, skills, and passion into action that makes a difference. Leaders are made, not born.</p>
