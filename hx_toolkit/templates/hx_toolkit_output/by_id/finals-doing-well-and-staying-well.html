        <h3>Doing Well </h3>


<p>
Now is the time to make sure you are organized (where are those notes you carefully annotated?) and have a schedule for the days leading up to final exams, papers, and projects. Continue to use effective time management strategies (it is never too late for good <a href="https://vimeo.com/456701888">reading tips!</a>) and work in review sessions and study groups.
