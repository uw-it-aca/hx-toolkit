        <h3>Strategies to Make It Easier</h3>
<p>Sometimes decisions are not life-defining but seem soul-sucking: Work on your essay for history, or do your environmental science homework? Attend the accounting club meeting or the leadership lecture? Decisions can be hard and take time, but having some techniques to use can make your life easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your choices and seek information; make sure you’re making a well-informed decision.</li>
<li>Make a pro/con list or a cost-benefit analysis.</li>
<li>Imagine the advice you would give to a friend who was struggling with a similar decision. Can you take your own advice?</li>
<li>Pretend you’ve made your decision: sit with it and see how it feels. Now repeat the process imagining you’ve made a different choice. Sit with it – what comes up this time?</li>
<li>Need to make a decision quickly? Set a timer!</li>
<li>For further advice, read a <a href="https://www.wisebread.com/a-94-year-olds-take-on-making-good-decisions">94-year-old’s take on making good decisions</a>. It just might put it all into perspective.</li>
