        <p>No matter where you are in your undergraduate career, you can always branch out and get experiences that will augment your classroom learning.</p>


<h3>Internships</h3>
<p>Internships – an opportunity to learn while working – are one way. The Career and Internship Center has resources for all stages; they can help you search for and find internships and also help you make sense of the experience later. Staff at the Career and Internship Center talked to students who shared <a href="https://youtu.be/oCz3pR5j8p0">their internship advice</a>.</p>


<h3>Options Beyond Internships</h3>
<p>Experience can also be found through other learning experiences outside the classroom like <a href="http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/">undergraduate research</a> and <a href="https://cele.uw.edu/programs/community-engaged-learning-formerly-service-learning/">community-engaged courses</a> or <a href="https://cele.uw.edu/students/volunteer-opportunities/">volunteering</a>. This is not just about working in a lab or volunteering at a food bank – there are literally hundreds of different ways to contribute. You might be surprised by what you find. </p>

<p>Doing something new and making connections with others can be scary. Remember that stepping out of your comfort zone can feel awkward and uncertain, but almost always results in rich rewards.</p>
