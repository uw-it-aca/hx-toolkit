It can feel hard – even impossible – to get experience when you don’t have any. You may know that connecting your education to the larger world is important – you learn more, you contribute something, and you make new connections. But how do you make it happen? 
</p>
<h3>Gaining skills employers seek </h3>

<p>
Any experience outside the classroom can be a learning experience, but the following experiences are designed to help you gain skills that employers seek: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Internships –</strong> Internships combine working with learning and can be a great way to explore different career paths. The Career & Internship Center has <a href="https://careers.uw.edu/jerry-baldasty-internship-project/">resources </a>to help students at each stage of the process – from finding and applying for internships, to making sense of the experience once it’s over. 

<li><strong>Academic research – </strong>Undergraduates can work with faculty and graduate students on <a href="http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/">research</a> projects, applying classroom knowledge and methods to real-world questions. Attending the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/">Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> in May is a great way to get a sense of the breadth of opportunities. 

<li><strong>Community-based work, classes, or volunteering – </strong>Work with <a href="https://cele.uw.edu/">community partners</a> and develop a first-hand understanding of local challenges and opportunities by signing up for a course with <a href="https://cele.uw.edu/programs/community-engaged-learning-formerly-service-learning/">community-engaged learning</a> , <a href="https://cele.uw.edu/students/community-volunteering/">volunteering </a>with community based organizations, <a href="https://expd.uw.edu/riverways/">tutoring in schools</a>, or working on <a href="https://www.washington.edu/dreamproject/">college access</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Take a risk, explore something new, revel in the learning.
