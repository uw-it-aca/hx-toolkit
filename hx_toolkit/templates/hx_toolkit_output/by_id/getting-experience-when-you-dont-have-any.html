        <p>It can feel hard – even impossible – to get experience when you don’t have any. You may know that connecting your education to the larger world is important – you learn more, you contribute something, and you make new connections. But how do you make it happen?</p>
<h3>Learning Outside the Classroom</h3> 
<p>Any experience outside the classroom can be a learning experience, but the following experiences are designed to help you gain skills that employers seek:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Internships combine working with learning and can be a great way to explore different career paths. The Career and Internship Center has <a href="https://careers.uw.edu/jerry-baldasty-internship-project/">resources</a> to help students at each stage of the process – from finding and applying for internships, to making sense of the experience once it’s over.</li> 
<li>Undergraduates can work with faculty and graduate students on <a href="http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/">research</a> projects, applying classroom knowledge and methods to real-world questions. Attending the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/">Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> in May is a great way to get a sense of the breadth of opportunities.</li> 
<li>Work with community partners and develop a first-hand understanding of local challenges and opportunities by signing up for <a href="https://www.washington.edu/carlson/students-3/browse-service-learning-positions/">service-learning</a>, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/carlson/service-opportunities/">volunteering</a> with community based organizations, <a href="http://expd.uw.edu/pipeline/">tutoring in schools</a>, or working on <a href="http://expd.uw.edu/pipeline/">college access</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a risk, explore something new, revel in the learning.</p>
