As a student, if you are not clear on how to use health insurance, you are less likely to access health services, even free preventive care.  UW staff who work in health care find that it is common for students to have difficulty navigating health insurance and the health care system.  Their biggest tip is to plan ahead — before you get sick — so you understand the steps to take, and what health care terminology means. By spending a little time getting familiar with these health care nuts and bolts, you will be better prepared for any fees that are your responsibility, know where to go if you get sick, and understand what kind of help you need and how to find it. This is particularly important with the current COVID-19 risks.

<h3>What Is Health Insurance?</h3>

<h3>How Can I Prepare to Use It, Even If I Don’t Yet Need To?</h3>


<p>
Be prepared for out-of-pocket costs by learning about your health insurance. <strong>Before</strong> you need to use it, complete these steps:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Get an insurance card</strong>. Make sure you have an insurance card. Take photos of the front and back of the card and store them on your phone in case you lose your card.

<li><strong>Learn what your insurance covers</strong>. Get information on  your deductibles, copays and coinsurance. Look into coverage of common health needs, like mental health counseling, urgent care and medication.

<li><strong>Find your network providers</strong>. Identify a primary care, urgent care and an emergency provider that are contracted (“in-network”) with your health insurance, so you will get the highest level of coverage. If you are from out-of-state, ensure that you have insurance coverage in Seattle.

<li><strong>Arrange for health insurance if you don't have it</strong>. For help doing so, contact:
