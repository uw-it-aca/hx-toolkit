        <h3>What Is Graduate Education?</h3>


<p>
Graduate education encompasses research, study and teaching beyond the bachelor’s degree. While undergraduate education leads to a bachelor’s degree, graduate education leads to a master’s degree or doctorate, also called a doctoral degree.
</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Graduate and Professional School?</h3>


<p>
<strong>Graduate school programs</strong> are academic courses of study that offer more advanced programs of study (beyond a bachelor's degree) in certain disciplines. This can mean earning a master's degree on its own or as a step toward a PhD program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Professional school programs</strong> help prepare students for careers in specific fields. Examples include medical, law, pharmacy, business, library, and social work schools. The length of these programs vary. Professional degrees are often required by law before an individual can begin working in a particular occupation.  
</p>
<h3>What Can I Do with a Graduate Degree?</h3>


<p>
Often, graduate degrees help people advance further in their careers and earn more over a lifetime. Some fields — such as physical therapy — require graduate degrees. Others, such as engineering, have opportunities for students with both baccalaureate and graduate degrees. Students may pursue a graduate degree immediately upon completing a bachelor’s, or they may return to graduate school later.
</p>
<p>
To pursue an academic career — teaching and conducting research at the university level — a doctorate degree is essential in nearly all fields of study. Teaching at a community college may require a master’s degree and professional work experience. For those teaching kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade, graduate degrees are highly recommended.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all researchers, whether they work in higher education, government or private industry, earn their doctorates, the most common of which is a doctor of philosophy degree, or Ph.D. Upon completing a doctorate, researchers, particularly in the sciences, may pursue a postdoctoral fellowship in which they continue study and research before getting a job as a professor.
</p>

<p>
"In the courses I taught, graduate students pushed me and pushed each other out of our comfort zones. No matter how many times I’d teach the same text, I learned something new about the materials—and my own assumptions—with each new group of students.  They do the same with our research by supporting it as well as pushing it forward.  We wouldn’t be the University we are today without them."
