Each job is different, but certain things apply to almost all jobs. Here are some things to know about starting a full-time job:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Work hours</strong> – The usual requirement is for employees to work between 8-9 hours per day with 30-60 minutes for lunch. Some companies have options for flexible work hours and even working from home (this may be more common given the pandemic). It depends entirely on the organization.

<li><strong>Benefits</strong> – Besides the salary you receive, you will typically be offered a variety of non-salary employee<a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/types-of-employee-benefits-and-perks-2060433"> benefits, which are </a>provided by a company in addition to a salary as a way to create a competitive package for a potential employee. These benefits may include health insurance (this is a requirement for larger companies), paid vacation time, sick leave, and retirement benefits. Some benefits are mandated by federal or state law to provide, such as disability and workers compensation, overtime, and unemployment benefits. When you apply for a full-time job, it’s worth considering the benefits you will receive.

<li><strong>Office culture</strong> – You may get an idea of what about the<a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/rally-the-team-how-to-create-a-cool-office-culture"> office culture</a> from your job interview. Once you begin working, you’ll get an even better sense of this. Observe from your new vantage point how people talk and interact with one another, how they dress, and what the norms are, both in person and online. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of your supervisor about what’s expected – and not expected – of you as you begin your new position. Many workplaces match new employees with an “onboarding buddy/ambassador,” someone with experience at the company who can answer questions and help orient you. Even if this isn’t offered, you can ask your supervisor to set this up for you.

<li><strong>Community</strong> – As in any new culture, you might feel a little lonely at first. Having <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/12-different-ways-to-make-friends-at-work-even-if-theyre-just-work-friends">friends at work</a> is important. Find potential friends and ask them to go to lunch or coffee. Say yes to invitations to join colleagues on social or work-related outings, and don’t be afraid to follow up with people you might click with. You have the perfect excuse for asking for a little of someone’s time: You’re new here and you’d like to learn more about what other people in the company do. 

<li><strong>Work/life balance</strong> – When starting a full-time job, it’s highly likely that you’ll experience a lot less flexibility in your days compared to when you were taking classes. Commit to establishing a <a href="https://my.uw.edu/husky_experience_message?article=no-time-be-healthy">healthy work/life balance</a>. Just like when you were going to school, you’ll want to be sure to exercise, eat right, get enough sleep, have fun, and engage in mindfulness practices that can help you reduce stress. You’ve got a long working career ahead of you, and establishing these habits early on will keep you happy in your life and your work.
</li>
</ul>
