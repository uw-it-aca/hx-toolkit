Got an interview coming up? Remember that your behavior and people skills are just as important to getting the job as your resume, experience, training, and technical abilities. You want to demonstrate by the way you conduct yourself that you have the important qualities of courtesy, respect, trust, and reliability. You also want to convey that you’re someone who would make a great colleague!  
</p>
<p>
Want to rock that interview? Here’s your guide.
</p>
<h3 id="before-the-interview">Before the Interview</h3>


<ul>

<li><strong>Decide what you’re going to wear</strong>. <a href="https://careers.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/01/dress-for-success-1.png">Professional attire</a> is the best option. Even if you’re applying for a more casual position, it’s still important to be neat and well-groomed. 

<li><strong>Practice polite, confident body language</strong>. Walk and sit with your head up and your shoulders back so that it feels natural. Your posture and stride can help you convey (and feel more) confidence, even if you’re nervous inside.

<li><strong>Choose a simple bag, briefcase, or portfolio</strong> to carry the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/what-to-bring-to-a-job-interview?from=careeradvice-US">items you need for an in-person interview</a>. If you are interviewing by video, make sure your background is not distracting. 

<li><strong>Figure out  your technology or where you are going</strong>. If you are using a new platform, test it out beforehand. If you are going to a physical location, make sure you give yourself enough time to arrive and settle in.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="at-the-interview">At the Interview</h3>


<ul>

<li><strong>Arrive early, but not too early</strong>. About 10 minutes before your scheduled interview is ideal. Before the interview begins, eliminate any other technical distractions -- you don’t want your cell phone vibrating while meeting the committee or your email client chiming when you are trying to hear a question.

<li><strong>Practice polite and warm greetings</strong> (and firm handshakes) and <strong>treat everyone you meet with respect</strong>, even if they are not part of the interview process. 

<li><strong>What to place on the table.</strong> When interviewing in person, you will likely be seated at a table. Place only your portfolio with copies of your resume, etc. on the table and/or a pad and pencil; everything else–bag, water bottle, etc.– should be placed next to your feet. You can also rest an arm and hand on the table. 

<li><strong>What to do with your body.</strong> During the interview, you want to appear upbeat and energetic without coming across as too assertive. Sit up straight in your chair and lean in slightly. Gesture naturally with your hands (not your body) when you talk. Leaning back or relaxing in your chair sends a signal of disrespect.

<li><strong>Make eye contact</strong> when you’re being asked questions and when you are answering them. It doesn’t need to be continuous, but it helps to communicate that you’re listening and focused.

<li><strong>Wrapping up.</strong> When the interview is over, thank your interviewers for spending time with you and reiterate your interest in the position. You may ask about next steps in the hiring process and when you might expect to hear back from them. Shake hands with everyone in the room, using their name if possible. Smile and keep your cell phone turned off until you are out of the building.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-the-interview">After the Interview</h3>


<ul>

<li><strong>Send a thank-you note</strong>. Immediately after your interview, write a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/follow-up-email-examples-after-interview?from=careeradvice-US">follow-up email</a> to each of your interviewers thanking them for their time, expressing your enthusiasm for the position, and including something thoughtful about your conversation. The follow-up conveys respect and can make you memorable to your interviewers.
</li>
