No matter where you are in your UW career — pre-major or nearing graduation — you undoubtedly have some academic requirements to fulfill. I&S, NW, VLPA...oh, my! By now you know these acronyms and have hopefully embraced the potential of general education requirements. If you still have a few left, here are some things to keep in mind: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Augment your major (and possible minor) with something different.</strong> Would a computer science or informatics course give your psychology degree a different twist? Could art history make you stand out among business majors? 

<li><strong>Follow your curiosity.</strong> Want to learn more about climate change? Interested in finding out how religion and politics intersect? There are experts on everything here!

<li><strong>Build your skills.</strong> If you are already a strong writer, what about public speaking or improv? Maybe you are not a fan of math, but you’d love to master Excel! 

<li><strong>Learn from the best.</strong> Explore the list of <a href="http://www.washington.edu/teaching/innovation/teaching-awards/nominees-award-recipients/">Distinguished Teaching Award</a> winners or ask your friends for their favorite professors. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not sure how to find courses that fulfill the requirements you need? Check out the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/genedinq.html">General Education Course Search</a> — you can choose a quarter, category (Individual and Society Courses, for example), number of credits, and time of day. 
</p>
<p>
Requirements should be more than just “checking a box.” Classes can be fun, expand your mind, and build your skills. Make the most of them!
