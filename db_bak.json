Find out how to take the first step in building a professional network.", "long_body": "<p>Getting to know people in order to build your career is called networking. If this word and concept intimidate you, know you are in good company; most people cringe at the idea. There are, however, some easy ways to make connections with new people and strengthen connections you already have.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>Your Current Communities</h3>\r\n<p>The good news is that you already have a network in your friends and family. Add to that people that you know from different social organizations, such as RSOs, sports teams, or spiritual organizations. These connections are part of your network even though you don't know them in a professional setting. They may work at a job related to one you are seeking, and they might be able to share information and contacts that could help you in your job search. Don't be afraid to say to your connections, \"I'm really interested in [name of field/job]. Is there someone you know who could help me learn more?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Making New Contacts</h3>\r\n<p>You might be introduced to someone at an event, or you might have the opportunity to set up an informational interview with a new contact. A good way to break the ice is to ask the other person  purposeful questions. People generally like talking about themselves, including what they do for work and their interests. Place your focus on getting to know your new contact and thinking about how this person might fit into your network. You're not asking for a job, just more information. Try: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What steps did you take that led to your current job? </li>\r\n<li>What is the most satisfying aspect of your job? </li>\r\n<li>What are the biggest challenges you face? </li>\r\n<li>What would you differently if you had to do it all over again? </li>\r\n<li>What one piece of advice do you have for someone starting out? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stay Positive</h3>\r\n<p>The way you present yourself makes a lasting impression. While it is normal to feel nervous or discouraged when talking to someone who might have a job connection, the key is to remain positive and optimistic when introducing yourself. Keep in mind that networking goes two ways \u2013 each person must benefit. Show an interest in the other person instead of focusing only on yourself and the outcome you want.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/jobs_come_through_people_you_know.jpg", "image_credit": "UW College of Arts & Sciences", "image_alt_text": "Students with name tags sit at a round table smiling and laughing.", "category": 2, "slug": "jobs-come-through-people-you-know", "phase": "A", "quarter": "winter", "week": 2, "related_articles": [4, 5, 29], "related_links": [1]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Your Friends, Your Success", "short_body": "Friendships are more important than you think.

Seek friends who can share with you your ups and downs, make you laugh, and get you out and doing things.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Academic help</strong> \u2013 Seek friends who can advise you on study strategies, recommend courses, or introduce you to new majors. Study buddies also matter \u2013 people who to proofread your drafts, quiz you before an exam, or simply study with or alongside you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Academic encouragement</strong> \u2013 Emotional support matters, too. Seek friends who will wish you luck on your exam, tell you you\u2019ll do great, and congratulate you or commiserate depending on the results. Supportive friends also help you deal with stress and understand your need to stay in when you really need to hit the books.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Intellectual discussions</strong> \u2013 Discussions about ideas are an important way to integrate your social and academic life. Whether you talk about small things you learned in class or tackle big controversial issues, these discussions deepen both your thinking and your friendships.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These types of supports don\u2019t need to come from the same friends \u2013 you might study with some and socialize with others \u2013 but together they function as an important part of a successful Husky Experience.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/your_friends_your_success.jpg", "image_credit": "", "image_alt_text": "Environmental Science students enjoy a group field trip to the North Cascades.", "category": 3, "slug": "your-friends-your-success", "phase": "A", "quarter": "spring", "week": 2, "related_articles": [3, 5, 29], "related_links": [3]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "You Are Your Network", "short_body": "Networking is a key part of the job search.

You can apply filters such as geographic location, company, job title, and what an alum studied at the UW. You can connect online through LinkedIn, which helps you broaden your network and provides access to <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-steps-to-a-perfect-informational-interview\"> informational interviews</a> and insider information that can benefit you in the present and future.

Take a moment to describe what you\u2019re feeling in a specific statement like \u201cI\u2019m frustrated that I spend so much time studying but still don\u2019t get the highest grades\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t get that internship.\u201d Acknowledging your feelings can lessen their impact.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Expect to \"win some, lose some\"</strong> \u2013 No matter how much effort you put in, you can\u2019t expect to always come out on top. Dealing with competition means developing a healthy attitude toward both winning and losing. Be proud when you\u2019re successful, and don\u2019t beat yourself up if you don\u2019t always excel. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Focus on yourself and your own goals</strong> \u2013 The \u201ceveryone else is better than me\u201d mindset disappears when you don\u2019t focus on everyone else. Focus on the goals YOU set for yourself. Be clear about what you want to achieve and work steadily toward it. Other people\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t matter. Really.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Cultivate a non-competitive environment</strong> \u2013 If you wish the environment in your program were less competitive, then work to change it. Use humor to lighten the situation, or offer help to others\u2013they may return the favor in the future. When someone announces an achievement, offer a sincere congratulations and then change the subject. Let your actions speak for themselves.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Recognize that admission into a competitive program is not admission into an elite program</strong> \u2013 UW has several capacity-constrained majors, and it\u2019s true that not everyone who applies to one of these majors can be accepted. Recognize that those accepted are not better people than those who were not accepted. Don\u2019t tie your self-worth to an institutional constraint.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>See happiness as a greater accomplishment</strong> \u2013 Finally, recognize that your happiness and overall mental health are more important than grades and school. Invest in friendships. Take time to play and relax. Super competitive students are usually not happy; focus on the happiness you can gain by caring for yourself.</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/whats_your_focus_learning_competing.jpg", "image_credit": "UW College of Arts & Sciences", "image_alt_text": "Close up of several students sitting in a row during a lecture class.", "category": 4, "slug": "wheres-your-focuslearning-or-competing", "phase": "A", "quarter": "winter", "week": 3, "related_articles": [17, 20, 39], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "Tired of Feeling Alone?", "short_body": "UW is huge. How do you find friends you really click with?", "long_body": "<p>One thing we've heard from students is that it's a lot easier to make friends with people who share your interests once you're in a major. Until then, however, it can be challenging, especially if you\u2019re taking large lecture courses where it may be difficult to get to know your classmates.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Right Fit</h3>\r\n<p>Some people get lucky and instantly bond with roommates or teammates, or find the community they're looking for in an RSO. However, if you're still feeling like you haven't met your tribe, don\u2019t give up. Finding true friends takes time, patience, and a little effort. Following are some strategies that might pay off.\r\n\r\n<h3>Conversations Over Time</h3>\r\n<p>First, look for opportunities to have increasingly more substantive conversations with others over time. Over the course of a quarter, classes, and maybe study groups are two places you're likely to see the same people repeatedly. Try to learn more about the people around you each time you meet. Strategies include: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Study Groups</strong> \u2013 Try taking 5 minutes at the start of your group for all members to \u201ccheck in\u201d and share in a sentence or two how they are and what\u2019s going on for them. You\u2019ll get to know each other better this way, and can always follow up after the study session is over.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Classes</strong> \u2013 In small classes, it's a lot easier to see the same people repeatedly. Take advantage of time before and after class, or when assigned to a group, to introduce yourself. Over time, move from talking about things related to the class to things beyond the class. Students often say that the quarter ends just as they\u2019re starting to know their classmates. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll see a classmate again but would like to continue getting to know them, tell them. It can be as simple as, \u201cIt was fun working with you this quarter. Would you like to keep in touch?\u201d</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Express Your Values</h3>\r\n<p>Second, express your values. Often the people we \u201cclick\u201d with are people who share our values or interests, or who have similar personality traits or life experiences. The values or experiences that count, however, may not be visible from the outside. Look for ways that people elect to show what they care about \u2013 joining RSOs, volunteering, participating in certain events \u2013 and do the same. Get to know some people in these environments, and ask them to introduce you to other people they know. The more broad your interactions, the more likely you\u2019ll eventually find the folks that make you feel at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Serendipity</h3>\r\n<p>Finally, be open to chance opportunities to engage with people around you. You never know when a shared experience (missed bus?) will lead you to discover that you and a stranger have something meaningful in common.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/tired_feeling_alone.jpg", "image_credit": "Dennis Wise", "image_alt_text": "A crowd of students walking to classes on Red Square.", "category": 3, "slug": "tired-feeling-alone", "phase": "B", "quarter": "winter", "week": 3, "related_articles": [24, 31, 44], "related_links": [4, 5]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Finding Your New Favorite Class", "short_body": "We have tips for finding something you love.

The trick is to slip in activities that are truly restorative and nourishing.", "long_body": "<p>The college lifestyle doesn\u2019t exactly encourage discipline when it comes to getting a good night\u2019s sleep, exercising, and eating healthy. And if you\u2019re crazy busy or feeling stressed, the last thing you want to hear is someone reminding you to take care of your health. But you probably know this already: when you prioritize your health, tasks that seem overwhelming suddenly become manageable. And over time, you\u2019re likely to be happier and better able to handle your work and other challenges if you attend to your wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Start Small and Nourish</h3>\r\n<p>If your time is truly limited, try to make space for small activities that will restore and nourish your body and brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some options we found that are great rejuvenators:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Breathe deeply</strong> \u2013 First thing in the morning, in the shower, on the bus, any time you think of it. Take 5-10 deep breaths that fill your belly and lungs, and exhale slowly. That extra boost of oxygen will clear your mind and help reduce stress.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Meditate</strong> \u2013 This is more intentional deep breathing, where you find a place to sit, close your eyes, and focus carefully on your inhale and exhale. Acknowledge when thoughts appear, then go back to the breath without any judgment. 15-20 minutes is ideal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Engage your senses</strong> \u2013 Prepare a good meal if you can, or at least eat one, slowing down to savor the tastes and textures. Close your eyes and listen fully to your favorite music. Take a walk outside in nature, taking in the smells and temperature of the air. Draw or color. If you're so lucky, play or snuggle with a furry pet.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Move</strong> \u2013 Do anything to get your blood pumping for at least a minute, multiple times a day. 25 jumping jacks. Wild dancing to your favorite tunes. Skipping across the quad \u2013 getting outside provides an extra boost. This kind of movement can interrupt the stress response. And it will probably make you want to move more often, for longer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Feel gratitude</strong> \u2013 When you spend time thinking about someone or something you appreciate, you release positive brain chemicals. New brain science says that you\u2019re a tiny bit healthier whenever you conjure a positive emotional thought. Make it a goal every day to conjure more positive thoughts than negative. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Say no</strong> \u2013 To whatever you know will cause you to overextend yourself. Or whatever doesn\u2019t feel right for you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Say yes</strong> \u2013 To goofing around and laughing hard. To spending time talking with others \u2013 in person or on the phone.

Most problems facing humanity are extremely complex, and their solutions require thousands of contributors, from many disciplines and with diverse skill sets.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategies to Get You Started</h3>\r\n<p>If you're set on tackling world issues, you might start by identifying the ways you like to tackle and solve problems generally. Do you like being \"up close and personal\" with a problem \u2013 on the ground administering vaccines, for example \u2013 or do you prefer to address \"the big picture\" \u2013 maybe monitoring the path of an epidemic? The next step is to identify which disciplines (and majors) best align with your preferred approach. One way to do this is by searching UW.edu or UW Today for news about faculty or organizations working on the issues you care about. Find the people mentioned and make an appointment to talk to them. Try to get a sense of the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How are they approaching the problem?</li>\r\n<li>What types of questions are they asking?</li> \r\n<li>What tools and methods are they bringing to bear on the problem?</li> \r\n<li>What knowledge and skills do they anticipate will be needed to effectively address this problem in the future?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another strategy is to <a href=\"https://myplan.uw.edu\">search for courses</a> with key words related to the issue you care about. Talk to a librarian to learn more about the perspectives different disciplines bring to bear on this issue. Know of a major that might be of interest? Find someone in that major and talk to them about how problems are approached in that discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Forge a New Path</h3>\r\n<p>Finally, recognize that you may get to create your own career path through a combination of courses and majors; it's rare to find a major that exactly matches a career.

They may have been praised for their abilities when they were younger and may feel like they don\u2019t need to put in a lot of effort because their achievements have always \u201cjust come naturally.\u201d When people with a fixed mindset encounter a genuine challenge, they begin to doubt their abilities and avoid taking risks in the future, for fear of looking like a failure or having their deficiencies exposed. They\u2019re also not very good at hearing critical feedback, because what they hear is that someone is disappointed in them, not that there are ways that they can improve their work, or their relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Growth Mindset</h3>\r\n<p>In contrast, people with a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d believe that qualities like intelligence, creativity, and even the capacity for positive relationships can be developed through effort and practice. They are not defined by their failures, but see them as an opportunity to try harder next time. When they encounter a challenge, they\u2019re motivated to find a solution and may encourage themselves with the thought, \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer&#8230;yet.\u201d In addition, people with a growth mindset welcome critical feedback, because they know it will tell them where they need to place their effort in order to succeed, in their work or relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Cultivating Resilience</h3>\r\n<p>You may have a fixed or growth mindset at different times in your life, or in different areas of your life.

Although it\u2019s natural for us to monitor our thoughts and behaviors, assigning a negative value to our experiences can get us caught in an unhelpful rut \u2013 like when we needlessly re-play an embarrassing moment or berate ourselves for missing that one question on an exam. This is when self-criticism can be harmful and counterproductive. While we may think self-criticism is necessary to keep us trying our best, research shows the opposite: <strong>self-criticism actually leads to decreased motivation and productivity</strong>.</p> \r\n<h3>Self-Criticism vs. Self-Compassion</h3>\r\n<p>The solution? Self-compassion \u2013 \u201cthe practice of being kind and understanding to ourselves when confronted with a personal flaw or failure.\u201d Rather than obsessing over our mistakes, the goal is to acknowledge and let go of them, so that we can move on to the next step with clarity and acceptance. When we quiet down the regions of the brain involved in worry, guilt, and self-judgment, we\u2019re capable of achieving more.</p>\r\n<h3>Three Steps to Self-Compassion</h3>\r\n<p>Charlotte Lieberman describes three steps to self-compassion in her article:</p> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Commit to treating yourself more kindly</strong>. Call this mindset letting go of self-judgment, going easier on yourself, practicing self-compassion or whatever resonates most. You can also interrupt the spiral of negative self-talk by focusing your energy on something external that you care about, which can help you establish perspective and a sense of meaning beyond yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: Meet your criticism with kindness.</strong> If your inner critic says, \u201cYou\u2019re lazy and worthless,\u201d respond with a reminder: \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best\u201d or \u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Most important \u2013 Practice.</strong> Make a deliberate, conscious effort to recognize the difference between how you feel when caught up in self-criticism, and how you feel when you can let go of it. Think about it this way: How much better might it feel to take a breath after making a mistake, rather than berating yourself? Practice what it feels like to treat yourself as you might treat a friend. And make it a regular habit.</p>\r\n<h3>Where Does This Get Me?</h3>\r\n<p>The benefits of going easy on yourself extend beyond personal achievement. Self-compassion can also lead to greater health and happiness, more authentic connection with others, and a sense of purpose related to promoting the common good.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/show_yourself_a_little_compassion.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 5, "slug": "show-yourself-little-compassion", "phase": "B", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 8, "related_articles": [4, 25, 44], "related_links": [27, 38]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 27, "fields": {"title": "Finding Your Purpose When You Have No Clue", "short_body": "Allow yourself the space and time to explore your interests.

The drama major was designing sets at age three. Or the biology major firmly set on medical school, who always wanted to be a brain surgeon.</p> \r\n<p>Sometimes, it seems, everyone has a passion, the drive, and a plan. But how do you find your passion or purpose when you have no clue?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remember that college is a time of discovery.</strong> Consciously trying new things is vital to figuring out what grabs your attention and pulls you in. When you put yourself in a new environment, you literally change your perspective, and you can reflect on yourself and the world in new ways. Likewise, by trying novel activities, you\u2019re forced to learn differently. Here are some strategies for kick-starting your discovery campaign.</p>\r\n<h3>Explore</h3>\r\n<p>Whether you are new to Seattle or born and raised here, the city always surprises. Get out your U-PASS and hop on a bus to a part of town you\u2019ve never been. Check out the markets in the International District. Tour the Ballard Locks and watch salmon climb the fish ladder. Visit Picardo Farm, Seattle\u2019s original and largest community P-Patch garden. Talk to the merchants at Pike Place Market. Wander the meadows, beaches, and forests of Seattle\u2019s Discovery Park, and take in the views of the Olympic Mountains and Mount Rainier. (Getting out in nature and looking at a view are always good ways to expand your thinking.) <strong>Wherever you go, take note of anything that makes an impression on you.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Learn</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Look at your entry level courses not as pesky requirements, but as windows into other worlds.</strong> That required history class may spark an interest in research \u2013 something that could lead to a career as a private investigator, or market researcher for a media company. Even if you\u2019re an engineering major, take a communications course. If you\u2019re in the arts, explore human centered design.</p>\r\n<h3>Get Involved</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Student clubs, activities, and volunteering are some of the best ways to learn through doing.</strong> Whether you have been at the UW for a few quarters, or a few years, it\u2019s never too early or late to get involved. With more than <a href=\"https://uws-community.symplicity.com/index.php?s=student_group\">800 student clubs</a>, you can try everything from e-sports to African dance to birding. These three activities alone could introduce you to gaming design, ethnomusicology, and habitat conservation.</p>\r\n<h3>Research</h3>\r\n<p><strong>When you find a few things that pique your interest, dive further.</strong> Google those topics and read about them. Where does your reading lead you \u2013 any new ideas? Interview friends, professors, mentors, graduate students, professionals \u2013 anyone involved in what you\u2019re interested in. Ask them how they learned about their passion and how they pursued it. Did they do internships? What would they do differently? Would they do it again?</p>\r\n<p><strong>The key to finding your inspiration is to look for it. Don\u2019t wait for it to find you.</strong> Be open to possibilities. Get a little lost.

Manage your time well and it will benefit all areas of your life, now and after graduation. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Your Future.</strong> Ideally, you can use your part-time job to get an introduction to a career or explore an area of interest. Forming professional relationships at this early stage will help you gain employment after graduation. Even if you have a job that\u2019s not connected to your major, future employers still will be interested in your work experience and what you learned there.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Transferable Skills.</strong> No matter where you\u2019re employed, you will develop an understanding of the work environment and practice taking initiative, collaborating as a team, and solving problems when things go wrong. Doing all of this while earning a degree shows employers that you are mature and can effectively juggle multiple demands.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Balancing School with a Part-Time Job</h3>\r\n<p>It is a tall order to balance school, a part-time job, a social life and your other demands, but a lot of students are managing to do this. So how can you?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Be fierce about organizing your time.</strong> Get a paper or electronic calendar.  Try color coding to keep track of your shifts, important deadlines, and key social events.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Be realistic.</strong> Can you really cover that extra shift, or attend that friend-of-a-friend\u2019s party? There are only 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week. You can\u2019t please everyone, so only say \u201cyes\" to the most important activities. Saying \u201cno\u201d can be difficult, but it is a critical skill to practice and gets more comfortable as you do.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keep all the important people informed.</strong> Make sure your boss knows when you\u2019ve got critical lectures, tutorials and deadlines. Employers are usually pretty flexible about your hours \u2013 it\u2019s part of choosing to employ students. Talk to your tutor and lecturers as well. They may be able to offer a bit of extra support to ensure you achieve your academic targets.</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/the_value_of_part_time_employment.jpg", "image_credit": "UW Housing & Food Services", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "value-part-time-employment", "phase": "B", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 11, "related_articles": [16, 23, 30], "related_links": [40, 41]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 29, "fields": {"title": "Introducing Yourself", "short_body": "Introducing yourself in social or professional settings can often set up connections for the future.", "long_body": "<h3>Connect Effectively and Convey Your Message</h3> \r\n<p>Whether you are attending a formal job fair or mingling at an event, you want to capture a person\u2019s attention and make an impression in a few minutes.

A change of scenery can help you return to your routine refreshed & inspired.</p>\r\n<h3>Join a Club!</h3>\r\n<p>During your first days at UW, the sheer number of activities and opportunities can be overwhelming, but it\u2019s so easy to play it safe, fall into a routine, and never look back. When you\u2019re super focused on your classes and leadership activities, sometimes your hobbies fall by the wayside to your busy schedule. If you\u2019re stressed or feeling burnt out, doing something you\u2019re passionate about or enjoy can do wonders for your mood. Could an a capella group, the Hiking Club, the Cooking & Baking Club, or Badminton Club be perfect for you?

And it helps you build a network of contacts in that field, which can lead to a job. <strong>These talks are called informational interviews or career conversations.</strong></p> \r\n\r\n<p>Informational interviews are an informal way for you to learn about company culture, day-to-day tasks of a job, and career paths, and give you valuable practice for an actual job interview. Even if there are no open positions currently, there could be at some point. So treat the informational interview as if there's a job on the line. <strong>The key is to prepare, so follow the tips below.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Step 1. Schedule</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use your network to identify people who might be open to an informational interview. Alumni are usually happy to help. Friends or family might also be able to provide you with contacts.</li>\r\n<li>You can call, email, or write a letter to request an informational interview. Ask for 20 minutes of your contact\u2019s time, and remember you are not asking for a job, just information!\r\n\r\n<p>For example: \u201cHello, my name is Jamie and I am a sophomore at UW Seattle majoring in Business; I found your name and contact information on the Husky Career Network. I am exploring a career path in your area of expertise and was wondering if you had 20 minutes to talk to me about your job as a financial analyst. I would like to learn more about your job, career path, company, and the future of the industry as you see it.\u201d</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 2. Prepare</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do your research on the company, industry, and career field. Think about what you want to learn from the interview.</li>\r\n<li>Come with a <a href=\"https://www.uwb.edu/getattachment/careers/job-search-tools/interviews/informationalinterviewing/Informational-Interview-Questions.docx\">list of questions (.docx file)</a> you want answered.</li>\r\n<li>Bring with you your resume, a pen, and paper for taking notes.</li>\r\n<li>Dress appropriately, make a good first impression. You never know where your interview may lead.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 3. Interview</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Introduce yourself.</li>\r\n<li>When asked about yourself, give a quick overview \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.uwb.edu/careers/job-search-tools/networking\">elevator speech</a> \u2013 of your academic and professional interests, and any areas of interest within the field or company.</li>\r\n<li>Stick to the time you requested. If you asked for 20 minutes, don't take more than 20 minutes.</li>\r\n<li>Practice active and attentive listening.</li>\r\n<li>Ask for referrals. This is how you build your network and conduct more informational interviews.</li>\r\n<li>If time permits, ask the interviewer to review your resume. This is an added bonus to an informational interview.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 4. Follow Up</h3>\r\n<p>Be sure to send a <a href=\"https://www.uwb.edu/careers/job-search-tools/coverletters/sample-thankyou\">thank you</a> note or email. Thank the person for their time, information, and insight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conduct more than one informational interview.

When a group isn\u2019t working effectively, it\u2019s difficult to make progress and your ability to succeed is impaired. What to do? Take action \u2013 don\u2019t let your learning suffer.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Try the following suggestions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Name the problem.</strong> Let your group members know that you think the group isn\u2019t working as effectively as it could. Tell them (politely) what you think the problem is, and offer (or ask for) suggestions on how to fix it. (Here\u2019s a list of <a href=\"https://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/learning/problems-associated-group-work\">common problems with groups</a>.)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Recognize that effective teamwork takes practice.</strong> We\u2019re not born knowing how to work effectively with others, and even those who do it well can always improve. Identify specific communication and/or facilitation skills you\u2019d like to practice each time you find yourself in a group, or suggest this as a group activity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Set a positive tone.</strong> Try complimenting group members on their contributions or pointing out what\u2019s going well. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d \u201cThanks for sending out that timeline\u2013 that\u2019s going to help us organize our work.\u201d \u201cYay, everyone\u2019s here, we can get started right on time.\u201d</li>\r\n<li><strong>Look at your own behavior.</strong> It\u2019s easy to put the blame on others, and maybe rightfully. But also ask yourself if you\u2019ve contributed to the problem in any way. Do you dominate conversation, or want to control how things are done? Do you hang back and let others do most of the work? Are you late to meetings? Apologize to the group for any way you think you might have affected its functioning, and let them know you\u2019re working to change that.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Talk to the instructor.</strong> If you\u2019re doing group work for a class, the instructor can ask group members to do periodic evaluations of how well the group is working or what could be improved. Your feedback may also be welcome; sometimes the problem isn\u2019t with the group itself, but with the design of the assignment or the way the groups were formed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Long-term Value</h3>\r\n<p>As Beth Kalikoff, director of UW\u2019s Center for Teaching and Learning, states, \u201cThe world of internships, grad school, and careers involves other humans. <strong>The ability to work successfully and effectively in groups is valued beyond measure in the workplace.</strong> College assignments designed to teach group and communication skills, as well as content, prepare students for the real world.\u201d</p>\r\n \r\n<p>One of the best parts of teamwork \u2013 in class, in the lab, at work, or through a student club or volunteering \u2013 is that you don\u2019t have to do everything yourself.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/learning_through_teamwork.jpg", "image_credit": "Dennis Wise", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 4, "slug": "learning-through-teamwork", "phase": "B", "quarter": "winter", "week": 6, "related_articles": [6, 24, 38], "related_links": [47, 48, 49, 50]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 34, "fields": {"title": "Mapping Interests and Values to Meaningful Work", "short_body": "Meaningful work and a fulfilling career and life come when your strengths, values and interests map to what the world needs.", "long_body": "<h3>Why Meaningful Work Matters</h3>\r\n<p>Some studies, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151203112844.htm\">like this 2015 study</a>, have found that having purpose leads to a longer and healthier life, and meaningful work can be at the center of that. Researchers found that those who feel purpose often have healthier lifestyles. They are more motivated and resilient, which protects them from stress and burnout.\r\n<h3>The Four Components Of Ikigai (and of Meaningful Work)</h3>\r\n<p>Consider \u201cIkigai\u201d \u2013 Ikigai (\u751f\u304d\u7532\u6590, pronounced [iki\u0261ai]) is a Japanese concept that means \"a reason for being,\u201d the \u201cthing that you live for\u201d or \u201cthe reason for which you get up in the morning.\u201d <strong>Ikigai is the intersection and common ground between these four things:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What you love (Interests)</li>\r\n<li>What you care about (Values)</li>\r\n<li>What you can get paid for (Skills & Strengths)</li>\r\n<li>What the world needs (Opportunities)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Mapping It Out For Yourself</h3>\r\n<p>Making a map or diagram for yourself can help you gain clarity about what meaningful work might look like. Follow the steps below to create an illuminating map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1. If you haven\u2019t already, take time to reflect on your interests, values, strengths, and skills.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking yourself the following questions can help you define your Ikigai:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What do you care most about?</li>\r\n<li>What key moments or \u201cturning points\u201d do you believe were foundations to where you are now?</li>\r\n<li>What experiences \u2013 inside or outside the classroom \u2013 have you had as an undergraduate that provide insight or direction? Is there something new you\u2019ve always wanted to try?</li>\r\n<li>What, in your life as it is now, makes you happy? What things do you like to do?</li> (One way to think about it is the \u201cSaturday Morning Test\u201d \u2013 consider what do you do on a Saturday morning when you have nothing to do.)</li>\r\n<li>What would you like to see change in the world?</li>\r\n<li>What are you good at? What do you consider to be your top skills and strengths?</li>\r\n<li>What can you get paid for?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be radically honest with yourself. Don\u2019t be afraid to jot down whatever comes to mind, no matter how crazy or irrational it might seem right now. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to come up with answers in one sitting. In fact, it\u2019s more productive to take your time.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>It can be hard to see yourself objectively, so it may be very helpful to <a href=\"https://qz.com/1004823/the-secret-to-a-happy-fulfilling-career-dont-play-too-much-to-your-strengths/\">ask family and friends</a> to anonymously share with you what they see as your greatest strengths and skills and what they see as your most deeply held values and interests.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Finally, you can use these resources below to help you gain clarity on your interests, values, strengths, and skills.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://careers.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2017/07/Dependable-Strengths-2017-2018-1.pdf\">UW Career and Internship Center\u2019s Dependable Strengths Identification Activity</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://roadtripnation.com/roadmap/stepone\">RoadTrip Nation\u2019s Career Exploration Tool</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=plan-your-life-accident\">Plan Your Life By Accident</a></li> \r\n<li><a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=deep-learning-comes-from-reflection\">Deep Learning Comes from Reflection</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2. Draw a map and fill it out with your interests, values, strengths, and skills.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin by drawing a Venn diagram (4 interlocking circles for each of the Ikigai components). It doesn\u2019t have to be pretty, it is just to help you organize your thoughts and find patterns.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Find places on the drawing for your values, interests, strengths, and skills. If there is something that belongs into several categories, write it down in each category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start to look for patterns. What kinds of themes are apparent? Are there obvious intersections among categories, or do they seem disparate? If clear links aren\u2019t evident, don\u2019t worry\u200a \u2013\u200a that\u2019s normal. This process will take time. You can also <a href=\"https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/ikigai-japanese-concept-to-enhance-work-life-sense-of-worth/\">use this expanded map to analyze your map and gain more insights</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3. Be Patient, and Iterate.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Finding out what will be meaningful work and building a meaningful career requires devoting time to reflection and taking action to test things out. Rather than being something that you magically discover, meaningful work and your purpose will unfold and evolve over time. This is a living document, so it will change and evolve over time. As you start to test your Ikigai in the real world, you will strike out things and add others.</p>\r\n<h3>Apply and Test What You Mapped</h3>\r\n<p>The results of this mapping can be a guide. Aligning your actions with the \u201cthing that you live for\u201d\u2013 your Ikigai \u2013 can help <strong>inform choices that arise as you move forward. You can also use what you learn to connect you to people with similar interests and to identify opportunities to gain more experience in areas of interest</strong>. Let faculty, mentors, and advisers know what you are finding in your map and where the gaps are. <strong>Weave this into conversations</strong> with friends and family. As your career evolves and you\u2019re presented with more opportunities, you can rely on your evolving purpose (or Ikigai) to steer you in the right direction.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/mapping_interests_and_values_to_meaningful_work.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "mapping-interests-and-values-meaningful-work", "phase": "B", "quarter": "winter", "week": 8, "related_articles": [13, 15, 36], "related_links": [51]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 35, "fields": {"title": "Asking for a Reference or Recommendation", "short_body": "References and recommendations are often a key component for new opportunities", "long_body": "<p>Asking someone to provide you a with a reference or letter of recommendation is common for a job, an internship, a scholarship, or an application to graduate school.</p>    \r\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a Reference and a Letter of Recommendation?</h3>\r\n<p>People often use the terms \u201creference letter\u201d and \u201crecommendation letter\u201d interchangeably, but the two differ in both style and purpose.</p>  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A reference letter</strong> is a general endorsement of your character, knowledge, and skills. With a reference letter, the person writing it often gives it to the student or employee, allowing him to keep it on hand for future use. However, for a job, you may be asked to provide <strong>a list of references</strong> \u2013 people who can attest to your job qualifications. A hiring manager typically calls your references after an interview to learn more about you. Not everyone on this list needs to provide you with a reference letter, but this list will likely include anyone who has written you a reference letter.</li> \r\n<li><strong>A recommendation letter</strong> supports your application for a specific scholarship, program, job, graduate school, or other opportunity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>How to Ask for a Reference</h3> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Who to ask \u2013</strong> References can be professors, supervisors, mentors, or even coaches, but not family or friends. You should be confident that these individuals know you well enough to positively represent your strengths, qualities, and experiences. This is critical because your references can be what makes the difference in getting \u2013 or not getting \u2013 a job offer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>When to ask \u2013</strong> Two weeks in advance of the letter deadline or a job interview. This will allow you to determine, by the potential recommender\u2019s response, whether they feel like they could provide a positive reference.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How to ask \u2013</strong> In person, if possible, or via email.  Help the person see why your relationship is a good match for making a recommendation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What to include in your request \u2013</strong> You should include information that elaborates on your qualifications, or you can even offer to write a draft letter he or she can use as a model.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Follow up \u2013</strong> Thank your reference or recommender and let them know the outcome. Send a simple e-mail, or preferably a note, saying how much you appreciate them writing the letter or giving a phone reference, and how excited you are to get started in your new program or job.This creates meaning for recommenders and it also paves the way if you need to ask them for another!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>How to Ask for Letters of Recommendation</h3> \r\n<p>In most cases, a letter of recommendation is sent directly to the university, employer or program director. You might never see the letter; some organizations request that it come from the writer and not from the applicant.</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Who to ask \u2013</strong> Choose a person who can comment on your qualifications for the specific position or honor. Recommenders for graduate school should usually be professors. There needs to be at least a quarter\u2019s worth of history between you.  Lay the groundwork before you ask by asking good questions in class, going up after class to chat, or going to office hours.</li>\r\n<li><strong>When to ask \u2013</strong> A recommendation letter usually comes with a deadline. Ask at least 4 weeks prior.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How to ask \u2013</strong> In person, if possible, or via email.  Help the person see why your relationship is a good match for making a recommendation.  For professors, this could be what you got out of the class or how the readings changed your thinking in a way that was a catalyst for you pursuing this this job or program.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What to include in your request \u2013</strong> Any supporting materials (e.g., resume, CV, other letters of recommendation, bullet points of main areas you like to see highlighted)</li>\r\n<li><strong>When the deadline nears (or passes) \u2013</strong> If the deadline is near or the letter is late, send an email saying, \u201cI wanted to thank you again for your willingness to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf to [name of job, program or university]. As a reminder, the deadline is [day and time]. Thanks again.\u201d</li>\r\n<li><strong>Follow up \u2013</strong> Thank your reference or recommender and let them know the outcome.  Send a simple e-mail, or preferably, a note, saying how much you appreciate them writing the letter, and how excited you are to get started in your new program or job. This fosters a meaningful connection between you and the recommenders, and it also paves the way if you need to ask them for another!</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/asking_for_a_reference_or_recommendation.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "asking-reference-or-recommendation", "phase": "B", "quarter": "winter", "week": 9, "related_articles": [3, 5, 40], "related_links": [52, 53, 54]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 36, "fields": {"title": "Lead with Your Values", "short_body": "Values are the foundation on which we build and balance our lives.

This fear prevents many people from achieving their potential. <strong>But there are many benefits of public speaking \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to share your ideas and perspective and build self-confidence.</strong> Great speakers <em>developed</em> their ability to speak in public over time, and developing this skill takes practice \u2013 which means starting with a willingness to try, and try again, and view every opportunity to speak in front of others as a chance to improve.</p>  \r\n<h3>Four Tips for Conquering Your Fear</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Embrace the Nerves.</strong> It is helpful to acknowledge that we get nervous because we care deeply about the audience and our message. Although the rapid heartbeat and sweaty palms may make it feel like you\u2019re headed for disaster, studies show that performance actually peaks under moderate stress levels that activate your body and keep you alert.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Get Personal.</strong> Finding common ground with your listeners is key to any good speech \u2013 we\u2019re all united by the same human desires and fears. Don\u2019t be afraid to go there.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Let Your Style Shine.</strong> Being in front of an audience can feel vulnerable and exposed, the audience picks up on this and if you communicate a genuine message effectively, you will gain their trust.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Learn to Love Feedback.</strong> If you goof up or fall flat, don\u2019t look at this a setback \u2013 try to understand why you didn\u2019t do as well as you wanted to.

But how much of your focus on learning is because you have to and how much is because you want to? The latter approach is called lifelong learning. While it is unrealistic to adopt this at every moment, there are benefits to practicing - even after you graduate - this mindset. Lifelong learners are motivated to learn and develop because they want to; it is a deliberate and voluntary act. <strong>Lifelong learning can enhance your understanding of the world around you, provide you with more and better opportunities and improve your quality of life.</strong></p> \r\n\r\n<p>There are two main reasons for learning throughout life: for personal development and for professional development. These reasons may not necessarily be distinct as personal development can improve your employment opportunities and professional development can enable personal growth.</p> \r\n<h3>Benefits of Lifelong Learning for Personal Development</h3>\r\n<p>Learning for its own sake brings advantages:</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boosts your confidence and self-esteem</li>\r\n<li>Makes you less risk averse and more adaptable to change when it happens</li>\r\n<li>Helps you achieve a more satisfying personal life</li>\r\n<li>Challenges your ideas and beliefs</li>\r\n<li>Can be fun</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Lifelong Learning for Professional Development</h3>\r\n<p>Your capacity to earn is directly related to your willingness to learn.

This can lead to better results and a more rewarding working situation.</li>\r\n<li>From a financial point of view, a more highly skilled and knowledgeable worker is an asset to any company and can lead to faster promotion with associated salary increases.</li> \r\n<li>Someone who can offer more expertise will be of more value not just to employers but also to customers. Expertise is also, often, a key quality of an effective leader.

Learn what makes for good feedback.", "long_body": "<p>Feedback is a critical part of professional and personal relationships, and learning how to give good feedback will benefit you by allowing you to express concerns and collaborate.</p>  \r\n<p>It takes practice to provide honest feedback in ways that create connection rather than friction. Here is advice from behavioral and communication experts who say that, done thoughtfully, giving effective feedback can be a way for the other person to observe the consequences of their behavior and gives them an ability to make an informed choice.</p> \r\n<h3>What is Feedback?</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Feedback can be a gift of information provided to another person.</strong> Feedback is not flattery, punishment, or advice.\r\n<p>What is the difference between positive and negative/critical feedback? Is one better than another?\r\n<p>People behave with intention \u2013 feedback provides information about whether their intention was successful and/or what other unintended impacts occurred. <strong>Positive feedback is information on what went well and what to keep doing.</strong> Positive feedback improves relationships and promotes successful behaviors. <strong>Critical feedback is information on what could be changed or done differently.</strong> Critical feedback may be difficult to absorb and may produce defensiveness and negatively impact relationships. Sometimes the expression of it is as important as the content; experts emphasize that not being nasty is more important than being nice.</p> \r\n<p>What makes feedback effective?</p> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Immediate.</strong> Whether positive or critical, it is best to give it as soon as possible.  The more immediate the feedback, the easier it is to take corrective action or to repeat the success.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Specific.</strong> The more specific the information the better \u2013 avoid judgments or generalizations. For example, contrast this \u2013 \u201cI really appreciate your contributions at our group project meeting yesterday\u201d \u2013 with this more specific and detailed comment:\r\n<p>\u201cI really appreciated how you were able to identify the conflicting ideas and bring us together at our group project meeting yesterday.  We were all talking past one another until you spoke up and summarized our different positions and needs. I think the meeting turned around and our project will work out thanks to you.\u201d</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Giving Feedback: Image Centered Compliments</h3>\r\n<p>What are image centered compliments? How can they be helpful and/or problematic?</p> \r\n<p><strong>When feedback can be aligned positively with a person\u2019s values or positive self-image it will have a greater impact.</strong> When possible, include how the behavior is evidence of their positive character.</p>  \r\n<p>For example: \u201cYou stayed late to help out the rest of us group project members yesterday though I know you had other commitments. You are a wonderful team player and I really appreciate working with you.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>You can also contrast critical feedback with a person\u2019s values or self-image.</p> \r\n<p>Example: \u201cI know you really care about the team and so I was surprised you left so early yesterday when we had so much more work for the group project that is due this week.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Never use critical feedback to suggest a negative self-image.</p> \r\n<p>Example: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you left while we were working so hard, that\u2019s so selfish!\u201d</p>\r\n<h3>Critical Feedback</h3>\r\n<p>Why is it difficult to give effective feedback? Is it possible to soften critical feedback?</p> \r\n<p>Critical feedback can produce defensiveness and/or creative freeze.  People are often reluctant to provide critical feedback and don\u2019t provide specifics.  <strong>It is important to provide critical feedback privately.</strong> Take time to identify and acknowledge the positive and use judgement free language to soften critical feedback. Use \u201cand\u201d or \u201cwhat if\u201d, rather than \u201cbut\u201d and deliver it as a question.</p> \r\n<p>For example, \u201cI like how the PowerPoint is organized but it would be better with bullet points\u201d could be stated as \u201cI like how this PowerPoint is organized; what if we added numbered bullet points?\u201d</p> \r\n<h3>Acknowledging Context and Positive Intention</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Acknowledging the positive intent when delivering critical feedback reduces defensiveness and allows the acceptance of the feedback.</strong></p> \r\n<p>Example:  \u201cI have something I\u2019d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively.\u201d</p> \r\n<p><strong>Asking questions</strong> empowers the feedback recipient and allow them to express their own intent.</p> \r\n<p>Example: \u201cI\u2019d like to see if we might reach a better understanding about ______________. I really want to hear your feelings about this and would like to share my perspective as well.\u201d</p> \r\n<p>\u201cI need your help with what just happened.  Do you have a few minutes to talk?\u201d</p> \r\n<h3>Using \u201cI\u201d Statements for Critical Feedback</h3>\r\n<p><strong>\u201cYou\u201d statements can put the other person on the defensive.</strong> They tend to describe motivation or intent negatively.</p> \r\n<p>Example: \u201cYou were late and never called.\u201d</p> \r\n<p><strong>\u201cI\u201d statements are feedback about the speaker\u2019s emotional experience.</strong></p> \r\n<p>Example: \u201cI was worried when you were late\u201d.</p> \r\n<p>To sum up, feedback is most effective when it is specific and immediate. When it can be aligned positively with a person\u2019s values or positive self-image, it will have greater impact.  Soften critical feedback by acknowledging what is positive, then suggest \u201cwhat if\u201d to create a collaborative approach. Acknowledge positive intent and use \u201cI\u201d statements when delivering critical feedback.</p> \r\n<p>By practicing these ways to deliver feedback, honesty can create bridges rather than burning them.</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/giving_effective_feedback.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "giving-effective-feedback", "phase": "B", "quarter": "spring", "week": 6, "related_articles": [4, 33, 44], "related_links": [65, 66, 67]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 43, "fields": {"title": "Preparing for Professional Life", "short_body": "Some things to keep in mind when starting a full-time job.", "long_body": "<p>Each job is different, but certain things apply to almost all jobs.

Also, focus on your past successes, appreciate times where you achieved something difficult (like getting into UW! ;-) )</p></li>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Optimism \u2013</strong> Faith in your own ability to improve a situation; the belief that failure is not innate but rather based on things external to you.\r\n<br>\r\n<p><strong>Feeling pessimistic?</strong> Recognize that the future holds many possibilities; it is a source of opportunity for you.

In this top half you\u2019ll want to provide evidence of a good \u201cmatch.\u201d  One good way to do this is to include a <strong><em>Summary of Qualifications</em></strong> \u2014 an explicit list of your qualifications as they relate to the job description \u2013\u00a0as one of the first sections of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Highlight skills that match the position</strong>. Present your skills on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to match the way the employer has described the position. It isn\u2019t necessary to do that verbatim, but be sure to create this alignment however and where possible. Target a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to each new position you apply to, because although positions have similar or the same titles, employers may think about their position in different ways. A careful reading of the job description is the key to targeting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Find the skill words (keywords that a potential employer uses to describe required or desired skills) that match with your background. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Brag</strong>. <em>It\u2019s okay to brag</em>. You\u2019re awesome, so flaunt your achievements! Just make sure you\u2019re being honest.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Show personality</strong>. Highlight your organizational skills, your ability to collaborate, or your love of problem-solving. Talk about it, but in a professional way.  \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Use action verbs</strong>. The experience section of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lists the organizations you used to work at, your job title, and what you did there. Use action verbs to describe your job duties, responsibilities, and accomplishments. Action verbs are verbs that express physical or mental action, and using action verbs can help recruiters read and digest your information more quickly and effectively. Check out this list of <a href=\"https://careers.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/09/Action-Verbs-for-Resume-Writing-2016.pdf\">action verbs for r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing</a> and strengthen your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 today.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Use examples and metrics</strong>. Experience shouldn\u2019t read like a job description, it should read like a list of accomplishments backed up by data and metrics. Give tangible examples of how\u202fthe projects you worked on affected\u202fthe company\u2019s bottom line\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Have a clear message</strong>.  Review your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to make sure you have a clear and consistent message that helps a potential employer understand what makes you unique, highlights your accomplishments and clearly describes why you are a good match for the job.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Makin_Your_Resume_Competitive.jpg", "image_credit": "Janice Fournier", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "making-your-resume-competitive", "phase": "C", "quarter": "winter", "week": 9, "related_articles": [18, 66], "related_links": [73, 74, 75, 76]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 46, "fields": {"title": "How a Professional Job Is Different from Being a Student", "short_body": "What can you expect in a typical workday as a professional? You may be surprised by the similarities and the differences from being a student.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nGraduating from UW may be one of the proudest moments of your life. It marks the end of your long journey as a student and signals the beginning of your adventure in the professional world. But how is the life of a professional different from being a student? You may be surprised by the similarities and the differences.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUW graduates enter a variety of different fields, from business to tech to education and more. Each professional field will have subtle and different cultures and norms of operating, and it will take time to understand what is considered typical in your field or company and what is not. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nConsider the following as you transition from student life to working life:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Focus on the organization, not yourself<em>. </em></strong>Figure out how you can contribute to the organization\u2019s needs. After years of thinking about your own goals, your focus must shift while at work to the goals of the organization (or your team\u2019s goals). Professionally speaking, attending to the goals of the organization will benefit you in the long run.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>People skills matter. </strong> Being able to work well with others is a critical skill to have in the workplace. A person who is likable and pleasant to work with is more valuable to an organization than someone who is equally skilled but has a bad attitude. Plus, having personality conflicts or other drama at work can be very stressful for everyone directly and indirectly involved. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Meetings, not study groups<em>. </em></strong>You won\u2019t have study groups anymore, but you will likely have a lot of meetings where you work. Pay attention to the culture of the organization and get a sense of how meetings are used; they may be for brainstorming, decision making, for both, or for something else entirely. Also, remember that your role here is to contribute, and you can\u2019t coast. Observe, ask questions, and clarify things that aren\u2019t clear.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Collaborate, don\u2019t compete</strong>. Regardless of where you work, you will be part of a team with shared goals. It\u2019s important to understand that to move forward at your job, you have to learn to work collaboratively with your supervisor and your colleagues. This type of work includes being a productive, contributing member of the team and taking on challenges, but also knowing where your gaps and weaknesses lie. No one is expected to know everything and to do everything by themselves, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions or ask for help. Mistakes and setbacks are common in the working world, but these don\u2019t signal failure. Instead, learn to trust and lean on your supervisor and colleagues so you collectively can problem solve as a team and move the work forward in a healthy, constructive way.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Keep learning from others<em>.</em></strong> You won\u2019t have professors teaching you, but you\u2019ll still have many opportunities to learn. In the workplace, veteran colleagues can teach you critical processes, new skill sets, and sometimes how to navigate office politics.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>52 weeks, not 4 quarters<em>.</em></strong> UW life operates in quarters, with breaks every couple of months for students to refresh and unwind. However, most jobs will give you between 2 to 3 weeks off a year, which means the cadence of your working year will be very different than the life you are used to now. Working life is a marathon, not a sprint. Unlike final exams, you shouldn\u2019t cram in work and pull all-nighters before a major deadline. you will burn out faster and harder. Instead, think about how to build work-life balance into your daily workday. That may mean working steadily while you\u2019re at work, but allowing yourself to unwind and relax in the evening and weekends. You may be tempted to push yourself as hard you now do at UW, but remember you won\u2019t have summer break to recover from a brutal year. It will take time for you to establish and adjust to a new daily way to tackle work, but building a solid work-life balance will pay off in the long run in your professional career.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Annual reviews, not grades.</strong> Employers do periodic performance reviews (or \u201cappraisal\u201d) that are designed to help you improve your work, and they are of course also a way for employers to assess your performance. Depending on where you work, they\u2019ll happen semiannually, quarterly, or annually. Having this type of review might feel stressful, but remember that like any feedback, they are an excellent opportunity to continue to improve yourself. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Dress code</strong>. The old saying goes, \u201cDress for the job you want, not the job you have.\u201d This advice still holds true, even if business attire has become more casual. It\u2019s important to think about what you\u2019re wearing and how you\u2019re representing yourself at your new job. Professional attire varies widely depending on the organization, so learn about the dress code at your place of work: pay attention to how people dress during your interview, and talk with colleagues and supervisors about what professional attire looks like in that workplace.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Keep your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 updated.</strong> Just because you have a job doesn\u2019t mean you can ignore your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You\u2019ll want to be positioned to take advantage of any opportunity that comes your way. Remember to save significant accomplishments, contributions, compliments, and new skills you learn to your resume. Having these at hand will make periodic updating of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 much easier. \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/How_Professional_Job_Different_From_Student.jpg", "image_credit": "Mark Stone/University of Washington Photography", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "how-professional-job-different-being-student", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 9, "related_articles": [12, 53], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 47, "fields": {"title": "How to Persevere", "short_body": "Are you feeling like you want to quit?

There may be <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=when-quit\">good reasons for quitting something</a>, and a right time to do so, but psychologists studying the concept of \u201cgrit\u201d found that the capacity to stick with a task \u2014 particularly when faced with difficulties \u2014 is a crucial factor in explaining success.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are other good reasons to persevere. Persevering in the face of challenges can help you reach a particular goal, but it can also mean that you will likely learn new skills along the way to that goal. And Stanford Psychology professor Carol Dweck\u2019s work has found that by persevering you will become a better performer in the long term, having more success every time you reach for a goal.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"how-to-persevere\">How to Persevere</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce you are clear that you want to persevere \u2014 you\u2019ve made sure your goals are worth pursuing and carefully considered that your goals pose no unnecessary damage to your health, relationships or the like \u2014 consider these strategies to help you persevere. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Recall past perseverance.</strong> Bringing to mind past instances when you persisted can help strengthen your resolve and give you energy, focus, and determination to persevere now. Think about the last time you felt fierce, strong, stubborn, unyielding, clear, inspired, surrendered, on-mission, purposeful, focused, or committed. Remember it, and feel it in your body and bring it to mind when you feel you need resources to keep going. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Take a step, even just a small one.</strong> Identify one small thing you can do right now to make progress towards your goal. There usually is something that can be done. Identifying immediately actionable tasks and completing one is more beneficial than getting stressed about all the things that need to happen in the future to meet your goal. Take the step that's available; this will bring the next steps into reach and give you a boost for having made progress.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Set a reasonable pace</strong>. Work and make progress towards your goals, but avoid frenzied activity or panicked states of mind that will just burn you out. \u201cSlow and steady wins the race!\u201d\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Try other solutions.</strong> If you\u2019re stuck, make sure you've explored your options for other ways of accomplishing your goal or of getting through your next step. It can sometimes be helpful to brainstorm with others \u2014 a friend, adviser, family member, or counselor\u00a0\u2014  about possible solutions.<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Be patient and give things time.</strong> Don\u2019t forget that things take time. Dreams aren\u2019t fulfilled overnight, so don\u2019t get discouraged if things aren\u2019t happening quickly enough. If you\u2019ve just embarked on an effort, it\u2019s especially important to give the effort time so that you don\u2019t let the newness of it scare you off. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Just keep going (even if it\u2019s only in your mind).</strong> Remember that your efforts will pay off by putting one foot in front of the other. And if you\u2019re truly stuck and can\u2019t move forward (because you are sick, or blocked waiting on some external change), keep your spirits up. Know that being intent on your goal, not giving up, is progress in itself. You can take comfort in these lovely and self-compassionate words of wisdom by best \u2014 selling author and psychologist Dr. Rick Hanson, \"You can continue to reflect on what's happening, learn to cope with it better, and love the people around you. And over time maybe things will improve.\"\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/How_to_persevere.jpg", "image_credit": "Mark Stone/University of Washington Photography", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "how-persevere", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 10, "related_articles": [14, 24, 44], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 48, "fields": {"title": "When to Quit", "short_body": "Persisting isn\u2019t always healthy or beneficial.

But stubbornly pursuing a goal it isn't always the best thing. Letting go of goals is also an important skill to have, and it can be a healthy and beneficial optionLetting go of goals is healthy and can always bring some positive changes, so knowing when to quit something is an important skill to have. The considerations below can help you better tune into whether it\u2019s time to persevere, or time to quit. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"why-it-can-feel-hard-to-quit\">Why It Can Feel Hard to Quit</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen you\u2019ve invested a lot of time in something, or are simply feeling fixated on seeing something through to the end, it can feel hard to quit. Quitting can make you feel like a failure. You may feel frustrated at letting go of all that you have invested into an effort. And change is often scary, sometimes because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, and you\u2019re facing the unknown. It is also worth mentioning that in our society we predominantly get messaging that people who persevere are better than those who quit, but that is only one perspective and not always true.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"signs-you-may-want-to-quit\">Signs You May Want to Quit</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTake a step back and reflect on how you feel and what you\u2019ve experienced recently. If some or many of these signs below resonate as true for you, it may be time to quit. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Prolonged neglect of basic care (meals, sleep).</strong> Severe suffering or consistent and prolonged neglect of basic care or sustenance (meals, sleep). \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Feeling more negative than positive feelings.</strong> Are you consistently experiencing more frustration than you are rewards? Certainly if your experience is overwhelmingly negative for a long period of time, you should seriously consider some radical change. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Friends tell you to quit</strong>. What are your friends telling you about this effort or dilemma? Are they telling you quit? It can be hard to see a situation objectively, so paying attention to what people around you are seeing and saying is critical.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Imagining quitting feels great</strong>. Do you breathe a sigh of relief and does your life feel instantly better with the mere thought of quitting? That may be a clear indicator of what you really need. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>No solution is in sight.</strong> If you have difficulty envisioning a possible solution, have no confidence things will change, and feel that you\u2019ve exhausted your possibilities for resolving any issues that are causing the frustration or other negative feelings, this is an important sign.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Staying for the wrong reasons</strong>. If you are continuing to do something simply out of a sense of responsibility to someone else, because you are afraid of hurting someone\u2019s feelings, or because of a fear of the unknown that may lie ahead, then you may be staying in something for the wrong reasons. \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"benefits-of-quitting\">Benefits of Quitting</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMoving on from a pursuit can have many benefits. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Being open to a better alternative</strong>. Andr\u00e9 Spicer, Professor of Organizational Behavior at Cass Business School, writes about this in the Harvard Business Review. He states, \u201cremaining fixated on long cherished goals can also mean people ignore better alternatives...people who tend to be tenacious are also those who get trapped into losing courses of action.\u201d Another way to think about it is presented by <a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/30/the-upside-of-quitting-full-transcript/\">Freakonomics co- author Stephen Dubner, in an NPR interview</a>, \u201cTime and effort and even stick-to-it-iveness are not in infinite supply. Remember the opportunity cost: every hour, every ounce of effort you spend here cannot be spent there....\u201d\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Not wasting time and talent</strong>. Again, Andr\u00e9 Spicer writes, \u201cpeople who don\u2019t quit often continue with worthless tasks that are both uninteresting and unrewarding, ultimately wasting their time and talents.\u201d\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Better health, sleep, and mental state</strong>. A 2007 research study has shown that people who can let go of unattainable goals are healthier. Those who cannot let go of impossible goals are likely more stressed, show symptoms of depression, and can have difficulty sleeping.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is important to occasionally take time to look at your life\u2019s pursuits from afar, and as objectively as you can. See what resonates and what doesn\u2019t, and consider what\u2019s better in the long run. Recognize that life changes in ways that are hard to predict, and we sometimes evolve away from a goal. Weigh the potential to continue learning and developing incrementally against the costs, dangers, and myopia which can come with stubborn perseverance. And lastly, don\u2019t be afraid to <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=asking-help-normal-and-necessary\">ask for help</a>; it\u2019s out there for you.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/When_to_Quit.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "when-quit", "phase": "A", "quarter": "spring", "week": 7, "related_articles": [44, 47, 52], "related_links": [80]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 49, "fields": {"title": "Design Your Own Internship", "short_body": "Can\u2019t find an internship that offers the experience you\u2019re looking for?

Many employers (especially smaller companies or non-profits) would love to have an intern, but they don\u2019t have a formal internship program. Others may not have a Human Resources department or the resources to recruit and interview potential interns. Sometimes all it takes is for you to reach out to an organization (even units within UW itself) with a proposal for how you could add value. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"the-process-step-by-step\">The Process, Step by Step</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf designing your own internship sounds daunting, follow these steps offered by the UW Career & Internship Center:\r\n</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"research-and-reflect\">Research and Reflect</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Find an organization that you\u2019re genuinely passionate about</strong>.<strong> </strong>Maybe you believe in their mission, care about the population they serve, love their products, etc. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Reflect on what you want out of an internship</strong>. Do you want to apply your skills in a real-world setting? Learn something new? Experience a new work environment or different way of working? \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Identify a good-fit contact within the organization</strong>. One way is to research the company and see if there is someone who handles internship requests, or find people on LinkedIn who work for the company and see if they can point you to the right person. You can also use <a href=\"https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/perfect-informational-interview/\">informational interviews</a> and networking to find contacts. \r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4 id=\"write-and-refine\">Write and Refine</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Tailor your r\u00e9sum\u00e9</strong> to showcase your most relevant skills and experiences.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Write a one-page proposal letter</strong> (similar to a cover letter) that covers the following: \r\n<ol>\r\n \r\n<li>How do you know about the employer and why are you interested in interning there?\r\n \r\n<li>How can you contribute to their organization?

You might experience conflict with friends, family members, professors, co-workers, and even strangers. Conflicts arise naturally whenever human beings interact. Many people associate conflict with anger and hurt feelings, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. If you practice healthy ways to handle conflict, the process can build trust and support emotional growth. It\u2019s a great skill to learn, and for better or worse, you\u2019ll likely have opportunities to practice it during your time at UW.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"unhealthy-reactions-to-conflict\">Unhealthy Reactions to Conflict</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBefore you begin plotting revenge against your messy housemate, recognize that each of us \u2013 including you \u2013 has a personal history that impacts our emotional reactions to conflict. Negative feelings sometimes lead to old habits, such as \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Exploding angrily\r\n\r\n<li>Blaming others\r\n\r\n<li>Failing to really listen to the other person\r\n\r\n<li>Refusing to compromise\r\n\r\n<li>Completely shutting down\r\n\r\n<li>Avoiding confrontation\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nNone of these strategies is an effective way to handle conflict, and such reactions (e.g., dumping your housemate\u2019s dirty dishes on her bed or telling your research professor, \u201cI quit!\u201d) do us and our relationships more harm than good. Changing these habits requires practice.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"cultivating-a-healthy-response\">Cultivating a Healthy Response</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA healthy approach to conflict involves getting out of your reptile brain \u2013 the part that controls your automatic impulses \u2013 and into your prefrontal cortex, the part that allows you to think rationally. When you are first faced with a conflict, do a quick stress check on yourself. Try your best to relieve the stress you\u2019re experiencing in the moment (you can physically soothe yourself with deep breaths), and check in with your emotions: Are you feeling angry? Scared? Don\u2019t let your emotions overwhelm or take control of you. If you need a moment (or days) to collect yourself, take that time. A large part of healthy conflict management is the ability to notice your feelings, self-regulate, and make sure you\u2019re capable of communicating your needs. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"strategies-for-managing-and-resolving-conflict\">Strategies for Managing and Resolving Conflict</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTry practicing these four crucial strategies for managing and resolving conflict:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Think it over.</strong> Honestly assess the situation. Think about what the real problem is in the relationship and how you might have contributed. Have you continually said yes to your research professor\u2019s requests without ever voicing your need for balance? A conflict is rarely one person\u2019s fault, though there are times when that\u2019s true.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Figure out what you want to say and how to say it.</strong> Don\u2019t blame others. Instead, tell them what\u2019s not working for you and take responsibility for your part in the conflict. And do this early; for example, if your don\u2019t let your group members know right away what you need from them for the project to be a success, the problem can fester and become worse than it needs to be. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Really listen</strong>. Listen carefully to what is being said, and if you don\u2019t understand what is being said, ask clarifying questions. You don\u2019t have to agree with what the other person is saying, but you can demonstrate an empathetic and sincere effort to understand where they\u2019re coming from. Maybe your roommate is going through an extra stressful time at work and is having difficulty focusing; it may not excuse the dirty dishes in the sink, but it may help you understand why she might have forgotten them.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Work toward understanding.</strong> While it may be tempting to fight for your point of view or perspective, healthy and effective conflict resolution is not about winning or losing. Instead, focus on pathways towards mutual understanding, or at the very least, mutual respect. It\u2019s also okay to end a conversation if it\u2019s not going anywhere, or if it\u2019s becoming emotionally damaging or harmful. It\u2019s acceptable to say, \u201cI\u2019m not willing to participate in this discussion any longer. Let\u2019s agree to disagree for the time being.\u201d You can always revisit the conversation if all parties agree another conversation is productive and helpful.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nRemember, conflict is not a bad thing. We do not have to be afraid of confrontation. Conflict management requires patience, both for ourselves and for other people, but mindful practice of this skill is an invaluable tool.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Healthy_Ways_Handle_Conflict.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "healthy-ways-handle-conflict", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 3, "related_articles": [26, 44, 72], "related_links": [84, 85]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 51, "fields": {"title": "Good Relationships Lead to Recommendations", "short_body": "Need a letter of recommendation? Someone to act as reference? Lay the foundation before you ask.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nWant to build the kind of relationships that make it easy to ask for a letter of recommendation? UW\u2019s Dr. Tom Halverson has some advice. He\u2019s a lecturer and senior researcher in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies and a past recipient of the UW College of Education\u2019s Outstanding Advisor Award. Below he responds to questions he frequently gets from students:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>How soon can I ask for a recommendation?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nMy rule of thumb is there needs to be, at a minimum, at least a completed quarter\u2019s worth of history between you and the professor before you can ask them to \u201crecommend\u201d you for anything. I have had students ask four weeks into fall quarter, and I have had to decline because I didn\u2019t feel I had more than a pedestrian knowledge of who they were, or their work. \r\n</p></li>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I establish a relationship?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you want a professor to recommend you, <em>lay the groundwork</em>: Ask good questions in class, go up after class and chat with the professor, go to her/his office hours, etc. Also, give the professor at least four weeks before the deadline to write the letter. Usually, requests for letters of recommendation all come to us at once (they\u2019re all due about the same time), so give us a little time to manage the workload.\r\n</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>How should I ask?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nI think it\u2019s very important (if it\u2019s humanly possible) to ask for a recommendation in person. Requests via email seem (to me) like you\u2019re not really invested in the process. So make an appointment, or drop in to office hours, and ask face-to-face. Also in this personal request, it is always helpful when the student helps me see (makes a case for) why our relationship and /or the course they took from me is an appropriate (aka: legitimate) context for making a recommendation. In other words, what did you get out of my class, what did you do with the material, how did the readings change your thinking in a way that was a catalyst for you seeking this new opportunity?\r\n</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>Should I include anything with my request?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nBring with you any supporting materials that you think will be helpful. These could include a resume, other letters of recommendation you\u2019ve received for other programs/positions, bullet points of the main areas you\u2019d like to see highlighted in a letter, or connections to your relationship with this specific professor and their work/course that you\u2019d like them to speak to, etc.\r\n</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>What\u2019s a reasonable number of letters to request?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nI consider 2 to 3 letters to be a reasonable limit. And I prefer the requests to come all at once so I know what I\u2019m dealing with and can manage the process. I don\u2019t enjoy it when, two weeks after I get a request, I get an email that says something like, \u201cHey, sorry to bug you again but...I found a couple more programs I want to apply for\u2026\u201d If you\u2019re applying to more than three schools or programs, ask someone else to write a letter.\r\n</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>How should I follow up if the deadline is very near, or the letter is late?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nHere\u2019s what I like to hear: \u201cDr. Halverson, I wanted to thank you again for your willingness to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf for [name of program, school, or opportunity]. As a reminder, the deadline for completed applications is [date]. Thanks again, [your name].\u201d\r\n</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>Should I send a \u201cThank You\u201d?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYes! But a gift of any kind is unnecessary. A simple (and heartfelt) note saying how much you appreciated your professor writing the letter, and how excited you are to get started in your new program/job, is reward enough.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Good_Relationships_Lead_Recommendations.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "good-relationships-lead-recommendations", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 2, "related_articles": [32, 35, 65], "related_links": [86, 87, 88, 89]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 52, "fields": {"title": "Tough Relationship Decisions", "short_body": "There may be times when you need to set boundaries, end a relationship, or forge your own path. These tips can help.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nRelationships with friends, family members, and significant others can be complicated, especially in college when you\u2019re in the midst of tremendous personal development and change. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll deal with at least one tough relationship decision during your time at UW, and when you\u2019re in that situation, you can feel pretty anxious and unhappy. Here are some ways to respond:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Identify your limits.</strong> Everyone has limits \u2014 physical, mental, and emotional. There\u2019s a line between what you can accept and tolerate and what makes you uncomfortable and stressed. Do you get irritated when your mom calls nearly every day? Use these feelings to identify your limits. \r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Notice your feelings.</strong> Discomfort and resentment often signal that someone has crossed a boundary. In an <a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/10-way-to-build-and-preserve-better-boundaries/\">article on boundary-setting</a>, psychologist Dana Gionta suggests that resentment is often a sign that we\u2019re pushing ourselves beyond our own limits because we feel guilty. Even if we don\u2019t enjoy it, we might listen to a friend who\u2019s always complaining because that\u2019s what we think a \u201cgood friend\u201d should do, for example, or we study all the time in order to be the \u201cgood student\u201d our parents want us to be. Resentment often arises when we feel unappreciated or taken advantage of, or when someone imposes their expectations, views, or values on us. \r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Set healthy boundaries.</strong> Setting boundaries is a way to take care of yourself. Good relationships require space for individuals to be themselves and make independent choices; they aren\u2019t about being inseparable. When you set healthy boundaries, you will be happier and have more energy for your parents, partner, or friends when you choose to interact with them.\r\n<p>Think about your limits when setting boundaries, then ask for what you need. For example, tell your mother you\u2019d like to talk to her two times a week rather than every day. Let her know you\u2019d like to find times when you can give her your full attention. If you don\u2019t like to party but your friend does, you don\u2019t need to join him; instead, tell him that you\u2019ve noticed your interests are diverging, and invite him to join you on a hike instead. \r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>End a relationship if needed.</strong> Sometimes relationships need to be ended, especially if you are experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Other times, the decision to end a relationship is more difficult, particularly a romantic relationship in which you\u2019ve invested hopes for the future. You may find yourself going back and forth on a decision about <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-know-when-its-time-to-end-a-relationship_b_57e5e0b6e4b09f67131e42b6?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFaLizBy8uvoQWiYpBboIIKcOkmMjViSNr6pzlbDmwvoMRfwKh1FMfcF5xvV_EXXJmJg4bYcdki48MrPLrQWwE0zExkuIuB7iIg6z1oRXSs95jSWVqaJe1Dd4_kdcr4ZK4wdF8uIIM3Ke1r4MXON1A2euYTDXUm-fi_qQ9ZEY9t8\">whether to stay or go</a>. In some cases, you may want to seek counseling to see if you can improve the relationship. If issues can\u2019t be resolved, or if this is simply not the relationship you want at this point in your life, you owe it to yourself and the other person to break off the relationship. <a href=\"https://www.mydomaine.com/how-to-end-a-relationship\">Follow these tips</a> to break up in a way that is respectful.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Forge Your Own Path.</strong> Healthy relationships are those that support you and encourage you to live the life you want to live. You may have an idea for the way you want to live your life or a career you want to pursue that differs radically from others\u2019 expectations for you or from societal messages of what you \u201cshould\u201d be. Resisting the pressure to comply with those expectations requires courage.

Remember that your behavior and people skills are just as important to getting the job as your resume, experience, training, and technical abilities. You want to demonstrate by the way you conduct yourself that you have the important qualities of courtesy, respect, trust, and reliability. You also want to convey that you\u2019re someone who would make a great colleague!  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWant to rock that interview? Here\u2019s your guide.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"before-the-interview\">Before the Interview</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Decide what you\u2019re going to wear</strong>. <a href=\"https://careers.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/01/dress-for-success-1.png\">Professional attire</a> is the best option. Even if you\u2019re applying for a more casual position, it\u2019s still important to be neat and well-groomed. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Practice polite, confident body language</strong>. Walk and sit with your head up and your shoulders back so that it feels natural. Your posture and stride can help you convey (and feel more) confidence, even if you\u2019re nervous inside.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Choose a simple bag, briefcase, or portfolio</strong> to carry the <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/what-to-bring-to-a-job-interview?from=careeradvice-US\">items you need for your interview</a>.  \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Figure out where you are going</strong> and how long it takes to get there. Ask about where to park if you\u2019re driving, and give yourself plenty of time for traveling, especially if you\u2019re taking public transportation.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"at-the-interview\">At the Interview</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Arrive early, but not too early</strong>. About 10 minutes before your scheduled interview is ideal. Before you enter the building, turn your cell phone <em>off</em> (not on vibrate) and put it away.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Treat everyone you meet with respect</strong>. Security personnel, receptionists, anyone you encounter may be asked to give their opinion of you. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Wait without distractions.</strong> Introduce yourself to the receptionist and let them know who you are there to see. While you are waiting for your interviewers, sit attentively in the waiting area (no magazines, no coffee cups) with your feet flat on the floor or crossed at the ankles with your hands in your lap or on the armrests. (You can take this moment to do some mindful breathing.)\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Greet others politely.</strong> If you are seated when someone approaches you, stand up before you shake their hand. Look them in the eyes and smile. Offer a greeting like, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you\u2026\u201d and say their name using the appropriate honorific (Ms., Mr., Dr. Gen., etc) and their last name. Grip firmly (but not too strong) when you shake someone\u2019s hand; make sure your hand isn\u2019t limp.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>What to place on the table. </strong>Most likely, you\u2019ll<strong> </strong>be seated at a table for your interview. Place only your portfolio with copies of your resume, etc. on the table and/or a pad and pencil; everything else\u2013bag, water bottle, etc.\u2013 should be placed next to your feet. You can also rest an arm and hand on the table. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>What to do with your body.</strong> During the interview, you want to appear upbeat and energetic without coming across as too assertive. Sit up straight in your chair and lean in slightly. Gesture naturally with your hands (not your body) when you talk. Leaning back or relaxing in your chair sends a signal of disrespect.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Make eye contact</strong> when you\u2019re being asked questions and when you are answering them. It doesn\u2019t need to be continuous, but it helps to communicate that you\u2019re listening and focused.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Wrapping up.</strong> When the interview is over, thank your interviewers for spending time with you and reiterate your interest in the position. You may ask about next steps in the hiring process and when you might expect to hear back from them. Shake hands with everyone in the room, using their name if possible. Smile and keep your cell phone turned off until you are out of the building.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"after-the-interview\">After the Interview</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Send a thank-you note</strong>. Immediately after your interview, write a <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/follow-up-email-examples-after-interview?from=careeradvice-US\">follow-up email</a> to each of your interviewers thanking them for their time, expressing your enthusiasm for the position, and including something thoughtful about your conversation.

There is a reason you do what you do. Sometimes this is lofty and sometimes this is practical. For example, your only hope and outcome for passing Chemistry 142 may be to get into 152. This is okay.

But it\u2019s also a reminder of our commonality \u2014 we\u2019re all vulnerable to painful feelings, and most of us just want to be happy with the choices we make.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Managing_Procrastination_ALT.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "managing-procrastination", "phase": "C", "quarter": "winter", "week": 1, "related_articles": [23, 54], "related_links": [98, 99]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 56, "fields": {"title": "Considering Graduate or Professional School", "short_body": "What Is Graduate or Professional School? Is it Right for Me?", "long_body": "<h3>What Is Graduate Education?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGraduate education encompasses research, study and teaching beyond the bachelor\u2019s degree. While undergraduate education leads to a bachelor\u2019s degree, graduate education leads to a master\u2019s degree or doctorate, also called a doctoral degree.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What is the difference between Graduate and Professional School?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Graduate school programs</strong> are academic courses of study that offer more advanced programs of study (beyond a bachelor's degree) in certain disciplines. This can mean earning a master's degree on its own or as a step toward a PhD program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Professional school programs</strong> help prepare students for careers in specific fields. Examples include medical, law, pharmacy, business, library, and social work schools. The length of these programs vary. Professional degrees are often required by law before an individual can begin working in a particular occupation.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What Can I Do with a Graduate Degree?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOften, graduate degrees help people advance further in their careers and earn more over a lifetime. Some fields \u2014 such as physical therapy \u2014 require graduate degrees. Others, such as engineering, have opportunities for students with both baccalaureate and graduate degrees. Students may pursue a graduate degree immediately upon completing a bachelor\u2019s, or they may return to graduate school later.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo pursue an academic career \u2014 teaching and conducting research at the university level \u2014 a doctorate degree is essential in nearly all fields of study. Teaching at a community college may require a master\u2019s degrees and professional work experience. For those teaching kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade, graduate degrees are highly recommended.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNearly all researchers, whether they work in higher education, government or private industry, earn their doctorates, the most common of which is a doctor of philosophy degree, or Ph.D. Upon completing a doctorate, researchers, particularly in the sciences, may pursue a postdoctoral fellowship in which they continue study and research before getting a job as a professor.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What Kind of Degrees Can I Earn?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Master\u2019s Degree</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Means you have gained more depth of knowledge in your field of study\r\n\r\n<li>Generally requires one to two years of study beyond the bachelor\u2019s degree\r\n\r\n<li>Some programs require you to research, write and submit a thesis, or research paper, to graduate\r\n\r\n<li>Examples of master\u2019s degrees: \r\n<ul>\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Science (M.S.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Arts (M.A.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Public Health (M.P.H.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) or Master of Education (M.Ed.)\r\n \r\n<li>Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) \u2014 the highest degree awarded in fine arts\r\n</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Doctoral Degree</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Means you are an \u201cexpert\u201d in your field who can design, carry out and assess research\r\n\r\n<li>Generally requires four to six years of study beyond the bachelor\u2019s degree\r\n\r\n<li>Most programs require you to research, write and submit a dissertation \u2014 an extensive research paper \u2014 to graduate\r\n\r\n<li>Highest degree you can attain in most fields\r\n\r\n<li>Examples of doctorate degrees: \r\n<ul>\r\n \r\n<li>Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) \u2014 most common doctorate awarded\r\n \r\n<li>Doctorates also called professional degrees  \r\n<ul>\r\n  \r\n<li>Doctor of Medicine (M.D.)\r\n  \r\n<li>Doctor of Dentistry (D.D.S.)\r\n  \r\n<li>Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)\r\n  \r\n<li>Juris Doctor (J.D.) \u2014 for lawyers/judges\r\n</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What Can I Study in Grad School at the UW?<a href=\"http://grad.uw.edu/admissions/find-a-program/\"> </a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://grad.uw.edu/admissions/find-a-program/\">Anything you can imagine...and more</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cAs researchers, artists, and scholars, our graduate students innovate, create and lead.

UW staff who work in health care find that it is common for students to have difficulty navigating health insurance and the health care system.  Their biggest tip is to plan ahead \u2014 before you get sick \u2014 so you understand the steps to take, and what health care terminology means. By spending a little time getting familiar with these health care nuts and bolts, you will be better prepared for any fees that are your responsibility, know where to go if you get sick, and understand what kind of help you need and how to find it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What Is Health Insurance?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHealth insurance is a way to pay for health care. It is a contract between you and an insurance company that protects you from having to pay the full cost of health care when you\u2019re injured or sick. Just like car insurance or home insurance, you choose a plan and agree to pay a certain rate, or premium, each month. In return, your health insurer agrees to pay a portion of your covered medical costs. Payments by your health insurance are typically based on discounts they negotiate with doctors and hospitals.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>How Can I Prepare to Use It, Even If I Don\u2019t Yet Need To?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBe prepared for out-of-pocket costs by learning about your health insurance. <strong>Before</strong> you need to use it, complete these steps:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Get an insurance card</strong>. Make sure you have an insurance card. Take photos of the front and back of the card and store them on your phone in case you lose your card.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Learn what your insurance covers</strong>. Get information on  your deductibles, copays and coinsurance. Look into coverage of common health needs, like mental health counseling, urgent care and medication.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Find your network providers</strong>. Identify a primary care, urgent care and an emergency provider that are contracted (\u201cin-network\u201d) with your health insurance, so you will get the highest level of coverage. If you are from out-of-state, ensure that you have insurance coverage in Seattle.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Arrange for health insurance if you don't have it</strong>.

For example, the<a href=\"https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta\"> NIH Postbac IRTA/CRTA Program</a> provides paid work in a national lab and as well as mentoring; along the way you apply to graduate school and eventually become a researcher. \r\n\r\n<li>There are a handful of scholarships that fund graduate school and entry into foreign service careers.  Some examples are: \r\n<ul>\r\n \r\n<li>The<a href=\"https://www.paynefellows.org/\"> Payne Fellowship</a> seeks to attract outstanding individuals who are interested in pursuing careers in the Foreign Service of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\r\n \r\n<li>The<a href=\"https://pickeringfellowship.org/\"> Pickering Fellowship</a> is a program funded by the U.S. Department of State, administered by Howard University, that attracts and prepares outstanding young people for Foreign Service careers in the U.S. Department of State.\r\n \r\n<li>The<a href=\"http://rangelprogram.org/graduate-fellowship-program/\"> Rangel Graduate Fellowship</a> is a program that aims to attract and prepare outstanding young people for careers in the Foreign Service of the U.S. Department of State in which they can help formulate, represent and implement U.S. foreign policy. \r\n</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Other scholarships fund graduate school for an intended career in public service. One example is the<a href=\"https://www.truman.gov/\"> The Harry S Truman Scholarship</a>; the premier graduate fellowship in the United States for those pursuing careers as public service leaders.\r\n\r\n<li>Some of these scholarship-related opportunities provide access to job boards that you would not otherwise be able to use.  \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>\r\nWhat Are Some Financial Benefits of Applying for Scholarships?\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile applying for scholarships requires time and effort, receiving one or more lightens financial pressures and may allow you to pursue a project you proposed. By doing so you can make connections with key people that may help you advance in school and your career. It also gives you the freedom to take advantage of educational opportunities you are interested in having with less concern about how you will pay for it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSubmitting an application for an award requires a certain degree of boldness, and those who are naturally shy or lack self-confidence shouldn\u2019t let that get in the way of promoting themselves.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Applying_Scholarships_More_than_Money.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 5, "slug": "applying-scholarships-gets-you-more-money", "phase": "A", "quarter": "winter", "week": 5, "related_articles": [59, 60], "related_links": [103, 104, 105]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 59, "fields": {"title": "Scholarships 101: Finding Scholarships", "short_body": "Clear steps for finding scholarships.", "long_body": "<h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDid you know you are eligible for scholarships at any time throughout your UW career?

Seek feedback from your professors, advisors, writing centers and other mentors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAdvisers in the<a href=\"http://expd.uw.edu/scholarships/\"> UW Office of Merit Scholarships, Fellowships and Awards</a> are available to read and give feedback on essay drafts for scholarship, graduate school and other applications you might be working on. <a href=\"http://expd.uw.edu/scholarships/advising/\">Contact these advisers</a> to request an appointment for help with your personal statement.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"strategies-for-personal-statement-writing\">Strategies for Personal Statement Writing</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDo your homework on the scholarship you are applying for. Keep in mind the characteristics, requirements, expectations, and/or mission of the specific scholarship to which you are applying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nReflect on your purpose for applying, your past experiences and your future interests. A personal statement is not just a listing of your achievements. It is a narration that describes how your interests/plans/perspectives/motivations have developed and those experiences that have been critical to that development \u2014 why your goals are what they are and how that relates to the scholarship.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"know-your-audience-and-how-to-address-them-appropriately\">Know Your Audience and How To Address Them Appropriately</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLearn all you can about the nature of particular selection committees through both research and communication with scholarship foundations, past scholarship recipients, graduate students, interns, faculty, etc.  Scholarship websites and application materials often reveal the kinds of people on the selection committee, and such information can be used to shape material and decide on the level of technical detail and explanation needed. For graduate school, thoroughly research program websites and faculty members (read their <em>curriculum vitae</em> \u2014 that\u2019s the fancy term for an academic r\u00e9sum\u00e9); look for faculty members who are working in an area you are interested in so you can make a match; the biggest criteria used by graduate admissions committees is that there is a faculty member in your stated area who has space to accept a student.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Important Note</strong>: Don\u2019t write your personal statement based on what you think the selection committee wants to hear. Make it an honest depiction of who you are, what you want, and how you plan to get there.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"begin-drafting-with-the-expectation-that-you-will-write-multiple-drafts\">Begin Drafting with the Expectation that You Will Write Multiple Drafts</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMost people writing personal statements end up with a first draft that is fairly general, containing mostly vague statements and ideas that could have been written by just about anyone. Acclaimed writer Anne Lamott calls this a <a href=\"http://www.asu.edu/courses/fms209/total-readings/lamott-shittyfirstdrafts.pdf\">shitty first draft</a> and emphasizes that \u201cAll good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts.\u201d This is why personal statement writing has to be a process you work through. Multiple drafts are necessary to get past that initial draft, taking those general ideas and distilling them down to the essence of the information you\u2019re trying to convey, fleshing them out with specifics from your experiences. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile working on your first several drafts, do not limit yourself to a certain number of pages or words. Write out all of your ideas first, taking as many pages as necessary, then make choices about what is most important, and edit down. If you limit yourself from the beginning, you are more likely to leave important information out of the final draft.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"revise-revise-&-revise-again\">Revise, Revise & Revise Again</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt can take many drafts to distill your writing down to a final product that directly, concisely and persuasively presents your points. Continued editing and revising is absolutely critical to eradicate words, sentences and yes, even whole paragraphs, that don\u2019t actually contain any real information.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGiving yourself time to brainstorm, create multiple drafts, seek feedback, proofread and edit will help you feel good about your essays and will ensure they stand out among others.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Scholarships_101_Application_Essays.jpg", "image_credit": "Mark Stone/University of Washington Photography", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 4, "slug": "scholarships-101-application-essays", "phase": "C", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 7, "related_articles": [58, 59], "related_links": [109, 110, 111]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 61, "fields": {"title": "Moving Beyond Rejection", "short_body": "How do you keep going when you are rejected for something you really want?", "long_body": "<p>\r\nBeing in college is exciting and fun and often stressful.

Keeping <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/satisfactory-progress/\">satisfactory progress</a> in mind, what are the ways you can make another major or a minor fit? <a href=\"http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/minors/\">Minors </a>are fewer credits than majors and could be an easier way to explore another field. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>How much will it cost?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nAdditional time means additional cost. How much can you afford? When weighing the cost and benefit of additional study, also think about what you might gain from other choices \u2014 such as an internship or study abroad program \u2014 that you might invest in.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>What will you do?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nMaybe the most important question is <em>what</em>. What are you excited about? What do you want to spend your time, money, and talent on? Choosing another major or multiple minors is one way to reach your goals but don\u2019t lose sight of other options. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Who should you talk to?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/about-us/advising/\">Your academic adviser!</a> They are professionals who are here to help you make the best decision.

We encourage students to focus on what they want to learn, then talk to faculty, advisers, and staff about what makes the most sense for them.\u201d\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Considering_additional_major_minor.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 5, "slug": "considering-additional-major-or-minor", "phase": "C", "quarter": "winter", "week": 4, "related_articles": [8, 20, 76], "related_links": [116, 117, 118]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 65, "fields": {"title": "The Strength of a Diverse Network", "short_body": "Learn how diversifying your network can open up your opportunities.", "long_body": "<h3>Is it <em>What</em> You Know or <em>Who</em> You Know? </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEveryone knows that knowledge, skills, experience, and education are critical to professional, and often personal, success. This is often referred to as \u201chuman capital\u201d \u2014 what do you have and what do you know, as a human, to contribute to your work and community? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut who you know is also important. \u201cSocial Capital\u201d refers to your personal network, the quality of which is determined somewhat by size and a lot by diversity. Research shows that work effectiveness \u2014 as measured by innovation, accuracy, and profitability \u2014 is higher when teams have different perspectives, backgrounds, and ideas. In other words, more diverse teams are more successful. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the same way that social media can reinforce like-mindedness, cultivating a network of people similar to you may mean that you have a high degree of redundant information. While it is comfortable to be around people who think in a similar way to you, it is not conducive to learning or making new connections. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"diversify-your-network\">Diversify Your Network</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis sounds good, right? You want to be challenged and learn from others. Yes! But...how? Being at a place like the University of Washington is a great opportunity to meet new people with different perspectives. And It\u2019s easy when you\u2019re new to gravitate to people who feel familiar, even when you intend to break out of your comfort zone. So, how to begin? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMaking conscious choices goes a long way. For example, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-2JqgK4NdZXz8RzHQn1Idb80enz9bmPH\">who you sit by in class does, to some extent, determine friendship patterns</a>, so maybe you want to move around that big Kane Hall. Research also shows that people who attend networking events often talk with the people they know even when they have the goal to meet new people. Just remembering that might make it easier to introduce yourself to someone new. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere are four more ways to diversify your network: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Be curious</strong>. An easy way to get connected is doing more within your current sphere. For example, you could get involved in your living group or your faith community. You could take it a step further by exploring student groups or community organizations. Think about what you were excited about when you were first at UW and make a connection to that thing. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Be social</strong>. Invite several people to brunch or dinner and seed the conversation with an idea or question. Even if you are more introverted and this sounds overwhelming, start with one or two new people and have a smaller gathering. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Be altruistic</strong>. Adam Grant, a Wharton Business School professor, wrote a book that demonstrates that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3009323/extreme-giver-adam-grant-lends-us-his-advice-on-becoming-a-more-generous-lead\">the most accomplished people give to others</a>. Instead of thinking about what you can gain from another person, approach them thinking about what you can give them. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Be a little random</strong>. Curiosity combined with courage can often result in new connections. Ask that person in the art gallery what they think about the painting. Seek out the ideas of that faculty member or TA in that class that is not in your major. Volunteer for an event where you are a newcomer.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nChristina Fong, Principal Lecturer of Leadership and Management at the UW Foster School of Business, advises that students set aside some time to reflect on the diversity of their network: \u201cMost students understand and value diversity but it\u2019s easy to stay in your comfort zone and make friends with people who are very similar to you. Taking the time \u2014 maybe once a quarter \u2014 to reflect on whether you are pushing out of your comfort zone and creating connections that diversify the experiences, opinions, and perspectives in your social life can help us stay motivated to take new chances in reaching out to new and different friends.\u201d\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/The_Strength_Diverse_Network.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "strength-diverse-network", "phase": "C", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 3, "related_articles": [4, 5, 33], "related_links": [119, 120]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 66, "fields": {"title": "Writing a Stand-Out Cover Letter", "short_body": "Cover letters often make the difference in whether you get an interview. Make yours shine.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nYes, we know. Cover letters are hard work. Wanting a job is a vulnerable place to be, and it can be scary to write about yourself, to make the claim that you have what it takes for this job, and to admit your desires to a stranger. But this stranger (the employer) <em>wants</em> to know about you. By writing a good cover letter, you can make the hiring process easier for them. You want to introduce yourself in such a personal, compelling way, that the hiring manager quickly decides, \u201cYay! Here\u2019s one to interview!\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor this to happen, there are two things you want to be sure to do with your cover letter: (1) tell the hiring manager why you want the job, and (2) present a case for why you\u2019re the best candidate for the position. These are usually achieved through four components: a brief introduction, two meaty paragraphs, and a brief closing. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are lots of ways to write boring, easily recycled cover letters, but if you want to write one that\u2019s <em>outstanding</em>, we offer the following suggestions:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Start fresh for each position you\u2019re applying to</strong>. It can be tempting to recycle your cover letter for multiple job opportunities, but hiring managers can immediately spot generic language. Make each letter unique.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Address your letter to a real person.</strong> Try your best to find the name of the person who is hiring for the job. Sometimes this will take a little work, but your effort will be appreciated. It also reinforces your interest in the job, since it shows that you took the time to research the position.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Adopt a positive mindset. </strong>One way to make cover letter writing just a teensy bit easier is to pretend that the hiring manager has <em>asked</em> you to apply to this position. Imagine they already know you and think you\u2019d be perfect for the job. Write to this person.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Grab attention with your opening line</strong>. Start with something snappy; your goal is to have the hiring manager read on. Include something you like about the company or emphasize your passion for something the company does or stands for. And then tell them how you would be a perfect addition. <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples\">Find inspiration here</a>. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Explain why you\u2019re the best candidate</strong>. Carefully examine the job description, and identify the key requirements and priorities for the job. Then <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/guide/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/\">use stories to explain</a> how your skills and strengths match what the company is looking for. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Show them why you want THIS job.</strong> Employers want you to enjoy working with them, so mention something about the open position and the company (an upcoming project or new initiative) and why you find it interesting. Let them know, again, how your knowledge and experience could help make this project a success.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Finish strong</strong>. The closing lines are your opportunity to reiterate your enthusiasm and strong interest in the job. Check out the tips here on <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/cover-letters-are-hard-to-writebut-this-template-makes-it-a-breeze\">how to close</a>.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Sit on it</strong>. Yes, after all this effort, let your letter sit overnight at least. When you take it out again, put yourself in the role of the hiring manager: Does the introduction make you want to read on? Do you get a sense of the person behind this letter, and are they someone you would want on your team? Edit as needed, proofread three times (yes, <em>three</em> times \u2014 in your haste and eagerness to send the letter, it\u2019s easy to miss errors and even one error can give the hiring manager a reason to toss your letter), and then send. \r\n</li>\r\n</ol>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Writing_a_Stand_out_Cover.jpg", "image_credit": "Dennis Wise/Universitiy of Washington Photography (L); Mark Stone/University of Washington Photography", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "writing-stand-out-cover-letter", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 5, "related_articles": [53, 71], "related_links": [121]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 67, "fields": {"title": "Interviews: Frequently Asked Questions", "short_body": "There are some questions you\u2019re almost guaranteed to get during an interview.

While every employer has their own interview style, there are many common questions that come up during the interview process. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt\u2019s a good idea to review these frequently asked interview questions and practice your answers. You don\u2019t want to sound too rehearsed in your response, so practice enough to be familiar but not so much that your answer is inflexible and stilted.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThink of this list as a study guide; if you prepare answers to the questions below, you can focus on really connecting with your interviewers during the interview.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Tell us about yourself. </strong>This simple question usually kicks off an interview, but don\u2019t let its casual nature fool you \u2014 your answer can set the tone for the rest of the interview. Your answer should provide an authentic description of who you are, what you\u2019re interested in, and/or what motivates you in a larger sense. Sum up your academic and professional background briefly and highlight qualities you bring to the table.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Why are you interested in this position? / Why should we hire you? </strong>You\u2019ll want to review the organization\u2019s mission and vision before the interview and understand the requirements and responsibilities of the position. Organize your answer in three parts: (1) communicate your passion for the company; (2) connect your skills and experiences to the position; and (3) integrate your long-term goals with the current position and describe how they align.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>What are your greatest strengths? / What do you consider your greatest weakness? </strong>These two are tricky questions. While the answer itself is important, how you frame and elaborate on your answer may be more important. The interviewer is looking to see how self-aware you are. Don\u2019t describe yourself as perfect, but don\u2019t spend all your time highlighting your flaws. If you\u2019re sharing a strength, respond honestly, make sure your answer is relevant to the position at hand, and provide a real-life example. And if you\u2019re sharing a weakness, touch upon it briefly and describe the steps you\u2019ve taken to improve.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>What is your greatest achievement? </strong>This is your opportunity to brag! You\u2019ve accomplished a lot and have plenty to share; focus on events relevant to the position\u2019s needs, or that highlight your strengths and abilities. Try organizing your answer <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=interviews-making-your-case\">using the <strong>STAR</strong> method</a>: (1) describe the <strong>situation</strong>, (2) describe the <strong>task</strong>, (3) elaborate on the <strong>actions</strong> you took, and (4) highlight the final <strong>result</strong>. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Where do you see yourself in five years? </strong>This question requires a tricky balance between being forthcoming and being strategic. You may not know where you will be in five years \u2014 and that\u2019s okay! However, you should still provide a well-thought out answer. The hiring manager wants to get a sense of your long-term career goals and how the position and the organization fits into your plan. Stress the good fit between the position\u2019s responsibilities and your current skill set. Highlight how the job will help you build relevant expertise and new skills so you can advance in the field. Connect all your career goals to the position, company, and job field at hand. <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>How would your boss and co-workers describe you? </strong>This question will help the hiring manager understand how you work with others and what kind of team member you are. While it\u2019s difficult to speak on behalf of others, this is an opportunity to discuss your positive traits. You can use your manager\u2019s feedback from a recent performance review to describe your achievements, or share a short story that illustrates your strengths. Talk about 2 to 3 positive traits and how they contribute to a positive work environment and successful teamwork.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Interviews_Frequently_Asked_Questions.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "interviews-frequently-asked-questions", "phase": "A", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 1, "related_articles": [40, 68, 73], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 68, "fields": {"title": "Interviews: Making Your Case", "short_body": "Convince employers that you're a strong candidate by using the STAR method to highlight your skills and experience.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nPreparing for a job interview can be nerve-wracking, especially when trying to anticipate the types of <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=interviews-frequently-asked-questions\">questions an employer might ask</a>.

These questions are easy to recognize because they usually start with the following prompts:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Tell me about a time\u2026\r\n\r\n<li>Give an example of\u2026\r\n\r\n<li>Describe a case where\u2026\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-the-method\">How to Use the Method</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThink of the method as the format for a story \u2014 one with a conflict (the situation or task) and positive resolution (result):\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Describe the specific situation you were in or the event that occurred. Remember to be specific and to give enough information for the interviewer to understand the context. This situation can be something that happened to you in class, at a previous job, or in a volunteer experience.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Task</strong>: Describe what you were tasked to do. What was the goal at hand?\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: Describe the actions and steps you took to accomplish the task. Make sure to include plenty of detail and to focus on your actions and decision-making abilities. How did you contribute? While it\u2019s important to credit the larger group effort, an interview is the chance to highlight your skills and abilities. Don\u2019t let yourself get lost in the story \u2014  try using \u201cI\u201d instead of \u201cwe\u201d as part of your answer.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Result</strong>: Describe the result, what you accomplished, and what you learned. This is not a time to be humble. Celebrate the outcomes and what you did to get there! Elaborate on what happened as a direct result of your actions, and end with a positive and insightful conclusion.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"star-example\">STAR Example</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Situation</strong>: The UW student club that I started with two other students had seen a drop-off in meeting attendance and a lack of meaningful events. The other co-founders had started talking about closing the club.\r\n<li><strong>Task</strong>: My goal was to increase consistent meeting attendance by at least 500% (from 3 to ~15 students for every monthly meeting) and to hold one event a quarter with at least 20 attendees.\r\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: I collected the email addresses from all students who had attended our meetings in the past two years. I created a Mailchimp account and developed a weekly newsletter focused on our club\u2019s topic of interest. I collaborated weekly with the co-founders to develop the newsletter content, and I sent out the newsletter and used Mailchimp\u2019s engagement and data tools to track progress. I included meeting and event reminders in each newsletter, and I encouraged members of our mailing list to forward the newsletter to their friends, peers, and colleagues.\r\n<li><strong>Result</strong>: Our monthly meetings have consistently attracted 20 to 30 students for the past three quarters and our quarterly events have attracted 25 to 35 students. The weekly newsletter has consistently logged a 75 to 80% engagement rate and I have received feedback that my club members enjoy the newsletter content and find it useful. I have grown the newsletter to include guest editors and writers. \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"prepare-and-practice\">Prepare and Practice</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nEnlist a friend to help you practice your interview before the big day. Have them think of a number of questions that require you to use an example from your life to illustrate your skills, and utilize the STAR method in your answer. Practice telling three to five different stories \u201cabout a time when\u2026\u201d so you can easily call on these examples during the interview.

This is normal, and so common that there is a name for it: imposter syndrome.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"what-is-imposter-syndrome\">What is Imposter Syndrome?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nImposter syndrome is the feeling or belief that you've been given something you didn't earn or don't deserve. This psychological pattern leads to self doubts about your accomplishments and harboring a persistent, internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud. UW Professors Tim Essington, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and Ralina L. Joseph, Communication, describe it in this <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/343073967/d0be68340e\">video about imposter syndrome</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"do-other-people-feel-this-way\">Do Other People Feel This Way?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nImposter syndrome affects undergraduate students of all backgrounds and in different ways. Research has shown that impostor syndrome is more prevalent among women and minority students. Mature students who are arriving at college for the first time, or returning to college after many years away, are also prone to the sense that they don\u2019t belong (it may even have been a sense of impostor syndrome in their careers that led them back to campus in the first place.) Millennials, faced with constant comparisons to friends\u2019 accomplishments on social media, can be especially affected.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"so-how-do-you-combat-feelings-of-being-an-imposter\">So, How Do You Combat Feelings of Being an Imposter?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nImposter syndrome is so common at universities that UW has experts on the topic; Professors Ralina L. Joseph, Communication, and Alexes Y. Harris, Sociology.  Here are their tips on how to combat imposter syndrome:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Remember that most students are feeling the same</strong>. Although you might think that \u201ceveryone else\u201d around you belongs here, realize that most people in your situation as a new undergraduate or a senior about to graduate probably feel the same way. You can only find this out by reaching out to\u2026\r\n<li><strong>Talk with others</strong>, particularly those with similar academic interests, backgrounds and goals. Create a safe space for you and others to share your experiences and feelings, and to talk through your fears. Together, determine which fears are legitimate and which ones don\u2019t deserve the space you\u2019re giving them in your head. Hear <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByD9RayspjxhMGFEY2Yzc1dKSGc/view\">more about this strategy</a> from UW faculty member Tim Essington.\r\n<li>Once you<strong> find your ideal support network</strong>, tell them specifically what you need. For example, if you need to hear that you are brilliant and fearless right before you give a presentation, tell your friends. Their supportive texts and emailed testimonials to your amazingness will help you shine.\r\n<li><strong>Find ways to regularly relieve stress</strong>. Take cooking lessons, find a good gym or workout class, take walks, watch your favorite TV show. Engage in these activities without guilt or judgment.<br>\r\n<li><strong>Be professional, but remember not to take yourself too seriously</strong>. Find ways to have fun with your classes, your extracurricular activities and your role as an undergraduate student.\r\n<li><strong>Note and celebrate your accomplishments</strong>. It is easy to feel like you are not measuring up when you focus on how much your peers are doing and compare this to how much you have to do; today, this week, until you graduate. Break your major tasks down into manageable steps, and cross off each step when you complete it. Force yourself to pause each time you complete a major task. Appreciate how you are making strides with every step you accomplish. Remind yourself that you are moving through your degree, you are capable, and that your completed tasks are proof of that.\r\n<li><strong>Fake it \u2018til you make it</strong>. If you still feel like an imposter, act like you own the place. Walk through your world with confidence. Practicing self-assurance is a self-fulfilling act. Know that the UW does not need you to be special; we need you to be you. You are enough. You are in college to explore your interests and to learn, to enhance or find your career path, and to give back to your families and communities. Say to yourself, \u201cI do belong on campus.\u201d You\u2019ve got this.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Managing_Imposter_Syndrome.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "managing-imposter-syndrome", "phase": "C", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 5, "related_articles": [24, 25, 26], "related_links": [125]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 71, "fields": {"title": "Three Main Strategies for Finding A Job", "short_body": "Looking for a job and unsure how to get started?

We tend to rush to action, concentrate on our own talking points that will best the speaker\u2019s, and get annoyed by the speaker talking too fast or too slow.  When it comes down to it, most of us lack any training to listen well. For example, Toastmasters is an international organization that teaches public speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs, but there is no counterpart for gaining listening skills. Experts at ComPsych, the world\u2019s largest provider of employee assistance programs, including for UW, developed a workshop to address this gap. Here are their tips.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"8-keys-to-active-listening\">8 Keys to Active Listening</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith the constant distractions from our phones and social media, it can be hard to actively listen. But, if you can focus your attention on one person and one conversation \u2014 while in class, with friends, while networking or meeting someone new \u2014 it will pay big dividends. Active listening will help you get the information you need the first time, and, perhaps most importantly, allow the person to whom you are listening to feel fully heard. Here are some tips for practicing active listening:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>When the other person starts talking, focus on listening.</strong> Resist the impulse to interrupt. It can help to take a moment to relax your body.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Communication is more than just words.</strong> Listen for tone of voice and observe body language in order to \u201chear\u201d more. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Check for understanding</strong> by paraphrasing what you\u2019ve heard.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Notice when your attention wavers</strong> and bring it back to the present moment.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Listen for ideas and feelings</strong> (not just the words being said). \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Resist the habit of jumping to conclusions</strong>.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>When appropriate, take notes.</strong> This will help you focus your attention and will communicate to the other person that you care about what they are saying.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Doing so helps you resist the pressure to have an immediate answer, and gives you time to absorb and process what you are hearing.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"the-four-listening-types\">The Four Listening Types</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>The Non-Listener</strong> does just what the name implies. They don\u2019t listen!\r\n\r\n<li><strong>The Marginal Listener</strong> pays attention to what is being said at first but is easily distracted. They marginally listen and then all of a sudden\u2026 <em>Look! Squirrel!</em>...and they\u2019ve left the conversation.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>The Evaluative Listener</strong> is already excited about what the speaker has to say. So much so, that they already have data they wish to share, an alternate opinion they wish to refute or an argument to be made as soon as you stop talking. You have their attention, but they are evaluating your every word and then crafting a response or rebuttal WHILE you are still talking. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>The Active Listene</strong>r paraphrases back what the speaker is saying, uses body language to demonstrate the importance of what is being said and asks thoughtful follow-up questions.  \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"effects-of-not-listening\">Effects of Not Listening</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt its core, effective communication promotes a sense of trust. Conveying words, facial expressions and hand gestures ineffectively can erode home and work relationships. Leaving out details in your communication, forgetting to communicate important information, and not listening actively prevent you from being able to properly communicate in a way that is essential for sustaining a relationship. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nActive listening is a skill that can be learned, so make time to practice. By doing so, you can help others understand you, better understand others, and build resilience and maintain balance in the different areas of your life.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Becoming_Better_Listener.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "becoming-better-listener", "phase": "C", "quarter": "autumn", "week": 4, "related_articles": [4, 42, 52], "related_links": [129, 130]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 73, "fields": {"title": "Interviews: Asking Your Own Questions", "short_body": "At the close of your job interview, one of the final questions may be, \"Do you have any questions for me?\" You should.

Not asking any questions creates an impression that you are unprepared or disinterested, so take the time to prepare questions of your own to ask the hiring manager.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAsking questions can also give you the opportunity to further highlight some of your qualities, skills, and experience, and show the employer why you're a terrific match for the job. It is also a great way to get a sense of the company culture and how you might spend your days. Think of yourself as a detective gathering information. That way, if you are hired, your first week or so in the position won\u2019t hold any major surprises.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"use-these-questions-as-a-start\">Use These Questions as a Start</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDo some prep and create interview questions of your own. Remember that interviews are a two-way street; you aren't simply trying to get this job \u2014 you are also interviewing the employer to assess whether this company and the position are a good fit for you. Here are some ideas for questions, including why you might ask them:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How would you describe a typical day in this position?</strong>\r\n<p>You\u2019ll get a good sense of the big and small tasks that would fill your days.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>How does the organization evaluate success?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYou\u2019ll see if the company\u2019s values align with yours and how your performance will be assessed.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>What are the opportunities for advancement?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYou\u2019ll confirm that this job will help you on your career path.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>What is the company culture like?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nWhether formal or laid-back, you\u2019ll make sure it is a good fit.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>What are the performance expectations over the first twelve months?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYou\u2019ll set yourself up for success by learning goals up front.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>Where do you see the company in five years?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYou\u2019ll show that you think big picture and would stay on long-term.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><strong>Given my experience, what do you think is most important for me to learn in the first few months?</strong>\r\n<p>\r\nYou\u2019ll get a chance to hear the most critical skills to learn and experience to gain.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou don\u2019t have to ask every question; choose a few that will help you present as an informed and prepared candidate for the job. You can type up your questions and bring them to the interview. This is a place where it is fine to pull out your notes so you can remember what questions you prepared. Coming with very specific questions will allow you to impress your potential employer with your knowledge and interest in the industry while also determining if this is the right job for you. \r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Interviews_Asking_Your_Own_Questions.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 2, "slug": "interviews-asking-your-own-questions", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 8, "related_articles": [53, 67, 68], "related_links": [131, 132]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 74, "fields": {"title": "Discover New Worlds in Your Own Backyard", "short_body": "You can discover new people, new cultures, and new ideas, all without leaving the Pacific Northwest.

This kind of good stress is called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-eustress-3145109\">eustress</a>\u201d and is critical for keeping us motivated and engaged. We feel excited, and maybe a little bit scared, but we do not feel threatened or overwhelmed. There are many catalysts for this good stress (think about riding a roller coaster or starting an inspiring project) and it keeps us feeling alive and eagerly anticipating what is next. Of course, acute or chronic stress can lead to burnout and health problems; if you are overwhelmed or distressed and finding it difficult to engage in everyday activities, please <a href=\"https://wellbeing.uw.edu/\">seek help</a>.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Reframe Threats, Embrace Challenges </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYour perception matters when it comes to stress; seeing something as a challenge instead of perceiving it as a threat can make all the difference, both physically and mentally. You can often shift your perception by: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Focusing on strategies \u2014 what can you do (with your knowledge, skills, and networks) that can help you face this challenge successfully? \r\n\r\n<li>Seeing the hidden potential benefits of a situation \u2014 an impending deadline can be scary, but once it is finished, you can benefit from the result.\r\n\r\n<li>Reminding yourself of your strengths \u2014 as a UW student, we know you have accomplished a lot through hard work!\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nGetting into the habit of <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/become-more-of-an-optimist-3144818\">thinking like an optimist</a> can also help. Once you are in the practice of reframing threats as challenges, it becomes more automatic.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"stress-reduction-strategies-are-also-important\">Stress Reduction Strategies Are Also Important</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUW student Keertana Sureshbabu, a Peer Health Educator Leader through LiveWell (and a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/husky100/about/\">Husky 100</a> Recipient!) has this perspective: \u201cSince being in college I\u2019ve learned different strategies to manage stress, especially during peak times like midterms and finals. A helpful strategy I use is to switch up my studying environments. I tend to stay away from spaces on campus that I associate with high stress like the library during finals, and instead I find coffee shops off campus where I feel more relaxed and there is a mix of people going about their lives. It puts studying in perspective and helps me feel more at ease.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor those times when stress is too much, make sure you have some go-to techniques, such as talking with friends, <a href=\"https://webster.uaa.washington.edu/asp/website/\">finding academic support</a>, <a href=\"https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/mind/stress/real-life-mindfulness\">practicing mindfulness</a>, or <a href=\"https://wellbeing.uw.edu/recreation/self-care/\">seeking additional help</a>. \r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/a_little_stress_is_good.jpg", "image_credit": "University of Washington Recreation", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "little-stress-good-really", "phase": "C", "quarter": "spring", "week": 1, "related_articles": [31, 44, 79], "related_links": [133, 134, 135, 136]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 76, "fields": {"title": "Your Major: A Hypothesis", "short_body": "If your major does not define you, what does?

You might spend your first few quarters confirming your initial thoughts (\u201cyes, I knew history was for me!\u201d) \u2014 or discovering new information (\u201cwhat? there\u2019s a department of Classics?\u201d) that might change your path. You may still be in the hypothesizing stage or maybe you are fully settled into your major. Either way, you have the power to shape your degree, especially when you remember that your major is only one part of your degree. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>How Much Does Your Major Matter? </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe know that the question \u201cwhere do you go to college?\u201d is followed quickly by \u201cwhat\u2019s your major?\u201d The reality, however, is that <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=do-majors-jobs\">the importance of a major is not equal to the attention it gets</a>. Except for some specific cases (we see you, nurses and engineers), your potential profession does not dictate what your major should be. All majors allow you to develop as a critical thinker, problem solver, and communicator. But there are things you do outside your major that also can enhance your skills. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Your World of Learning </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYour major isn\u2019t everything; in fact, there is not one thing that is the most important aspect of your undergraduate degree. Instead, it is the sum of the parts that make the best \u201cwhole.\u201d If you want to make the most of your time at UW, what should you see when you envision your final transcript, resume, or LinkedIn profile? \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Courses that enhance or augment your major \u2013</strong> yes, those art classes or creative writing sequence can pair nicely with environmental studies \u2026 being a national park storyteller might be in your future.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Undergraduate research \u2013</strong> hands-on lab experience with cancer immunotherapy tells a story that is beyond your math major.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Volunteer work in the community \u2013</strong> experience with vulnerable populations is an excellent complement to that sociology degree.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Internships in different fields</strong> <strong>\u2013</strong> working in the music industry could emerge from a degree in business or anthropology or ethnic studies.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Adding a minor to that major \u2013</strong> you can indicate specific passions (human rights, perhaps) by adding on to your major with a minor. \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Next Steps </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/about-us/advising/\">Academic advisers</a> and <a href=\"https://careers.uw.edu/schedule-an-appointment-with-a-career-coach/\">career coaches</a> are here to talk with you about options and how you can build upon your interests with course work and experiences.

Would a <a href=\"https://hub.washington.edu/sao/rso-directory/\">student organization</a> focused on marketing allow you to put your talents to work? \r\n\r\n<li>Talk with a career coach about how you are trying to combine your interests. What can you do if you love art and are intrigued by business? What is a potential path for someone passionate about both literature and math?\r\n\r\n<li>Reflect on what you have learned inside and outside the classroom so far.

I feel proud that I took a risk, learned something new, and had success.\u201d \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Understand the Big Picture</strong>. Morgan, a junior in environmental studies, went with a friend to \u201cstuff envelopes\u201d at a local food bank. While she assumed the work would be mindless and easy, she did not expect to learn so much. \u201cWhile we were gathered around a big table, putting information into envelopes assembly-line-style, one of the program directors described how the food bank serves the community. I had no idea that working families often have to utilize the food bank in order to supplement their household budgets. This gives me a different picture of poverty and makes me want to find more ways to help.\u201d\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Build Valuable Skills</strong>. Monika, a freshman, started volunteering at a university district organization that serves homeless youth through a service-learning class. After the class was over, she stayed on to help with an event and spent many hours updating the organization\u2019s database. \u201cI can now put database management on my resume, which will help me as I search for a summer internship.\u201d  \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nHere are two more stories about community contribution and personal growth: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/boundless/oceanography-research/\">Sea Lessons: Peering into the Future of Our Oceans</a>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2019-01/mentoring-mastermind?utm_source=uwhp-topstory&utm_medium=readmore&utm_campaign=heymentor-kevintruong\">A Mentoring Mastermind</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nYou, too, can do good in the world while doing good for yourself!\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Doing_Good_Good_For_You.jpg", "image_credit": "Mark Stone/University of Washington Photography", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 4, "slug": "doing-good-good-you", "phase": "C", "quarter": "winter", "week": 2, "related_articles": [25, 34, 74], "related_links": [137, 138, 139, 140]}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 78, "fields": {"title": "Gratitude is Healthy", "short_body": "What is one thing you can do to be more productive and feel good?

Learn simple methods, right now.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nWe know being a UW student can be very stressful. Mindfulness can help you become more calm and focused while experiencing less stress and distractions.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What is Mindfulness? </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\u201cMindfulness is paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgment.\u201d</em> \u2014 Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D. internationally known scientist, writer, and meditation teacher <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUW physician Claudia Finkelstein further describes mindfulness as \u201c...a means to train the mind. It is more of a process than an actual product. It can be thought of as the deliberate practice of cultivating presence and turning off autopilot. It is not about escaping reality, achieving bliss, or an altered state. It is about being fully present to reality.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>How Do I Do It? </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDanny Arguetty, M.A., mindfulness program manager at the UW says you can informally practice mindfulness by aligning thoughts with behavior, that is putting your attention on what you are doing: washing the dishes, going for a walk, sitting in silence, listening to someone in conversation, taking a shower, focusing on the first few bites of your meal, etc. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFormally, you can practice mindfulness through meditation. One simple meditation practice (and simple is all you need) is described here: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li>Sit or stand with your back straight and eyes closed\r\n\r\n<li>Notice the feeling of your breath coming in and out. Pick a spot where it is most prominent. It may be the center of your belly, your ribs, or the tips of your nostrils. Your mind might be calm, or more likely, turbulently unearthing all your to do\u2019s, your internal voices, and everything that isn\u2019t resolved in your inner and outer world. The key is to <em>accept</em> whatever it is doing right now. \r\n\r\n<li>When you become aware that you are lost in thought rather than paying attention to your breath, gently bring your focus back to your breath and start again. This process of coming back again and with kindness towards yourself, kindly, and without judgement is the practice that strengthens the mindfulness muscle. The moment in which you notice that your attention wandered <em>is</em> a moment of mindfulness. \r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nThat\u2019s it. Meditating or any mindfulness practice a few times a week for three minutes is a great start. As you get familiar with the technique explore if five to ten minutes is doable. Eventually practicing three to four times a week will keep your mindfulness muscle toned. Give it a try.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Where Can I Practice? </h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can practice anywhere, and by yourself or with others. UW has many valuable resources \u2014 groups, lectures, and articles \u2014 that you can use to learn more or to get support in your mindfulness practice. The <a href=\"https://wellbeing.uw.edu/mental-health/mindfulness-yoga-meditation/\">Wellness site lists most mindfulness opportunities</a>, but you find a few more at the resources below.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/counseling/mindfulness/\">UW Counseling Center</a> has weekly drop-in sessions, workshops, and support groups that they offer (look under \u201cMindfulness Resources\u201d).

If you are in <em>dire</em> financial need and are experiencing unexpected financial hardships that may disrupt your education or prevent you from earning your UW degree, explore the <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/emergencyaid/seattle/\">UW emergency aid</a> support available.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"tips-for-saving-money-this-week\">Tips for Saving Money This Week</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of little things that can be done, starting this week. Changing habits can be a challenge, so don\u2019t feel like you have to do all of these at once, but pick one or two things to start with. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Cook at home</strong>. Cooking at home can often be cheaper than eating out and likely, it is healthier compared with what you can get if you eat out. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Coffee at home</strong>. For certain, making your coffee at home instead of paying 2 to 5 dollars every day is a way to save money quickly.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Carry snacks.</strong> A bit of planning can keep you from buying those expensive snacks during the day. Trail mix and fruit are particularly healthy and convenient snacks to have on hand.   \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Don't overbuy at the grocery store</strong>. It can be easy to overbuy and then end up throwing food away when you don\u2019t get to it. Try buying less food and pay attention to what you toss out. If you need, you can do another grocery run.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Wait 72 hours before buying</strong>. Putting a pause between the moment when you want to buy something and when you decide to or decide not to buy it (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/your-money/one-secret-to-cutting-spending-wait-72-hours-before-you-buy.html\">one New York Times columnist suggests waiting 72 hours</a>) can help you reduce your spending. A\u00a0waiting period allows to consider whether or not you actually need the item, whether something you already own can serve the same function, and what else you could do with the money. \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"other-ways-to-save-money\">Other Ways to Save Money</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Look for free events</strong>. There are many free events on campus (and throughout the city), so save money by hitting those up. Plus campus events are a great way to meet new people.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Get free online entertainment</strong>. Access free online content via sites like Kanopy (UW and Seattle Public Libraries both provide access to this free service) and PBS. If you currently subscribe to a streaming service or cable, you may be able to reduce costs by paying as you go rather than having a subscription.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Thrift and dollar stores</strong>. Dollar stores may not be cool (yet), but thrift stores are, and they are both great places to make your money go further. The Ave has several excellent thrift stores, and a dollar store! \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Clearance rack and coupons</strong>. Retailers, including grocery stores, typically have a clearance or sale rack, so browse the clearance area first for items you need. You can also find coupons online for your online or in-store purchases; there are dozens of online coupon sites. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Use cash for the extras</strong>. Determine how much you can spend on extras (discretionary expenses) such as eating out, drinks, shows, and then withdraw that amount in cash. Commit to spending only that cash. Once it\u2019s gone, cut yourself off from those extras. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Stop smoking</strong>. If you smoke, ending this addictive habit will save you lots of money, and <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317956.php\">you\u2019ll have much better health</a>. It may not be easy, but there are <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43293-quit-smoking-tips.html\">scientifically backed tips to help</a>.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Hungry Husky food pantry</strong>.

If you are having trouble making timely payments, contact your creditor. Don\u2019t wait and hope it gets better.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Avoid credit cards if possible</strong>. It\u2019s really easy to spend beyond your means\u00a0using credit, and there are high fees and interest rates associated with keeping a balance.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Pay off credit card balances every month</strong>. If you\u2019ve run up credit card debt, one of the smartest money-saving moves you can make is prioritizing paying that high-interest debt.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Save your spare change</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/acorns-mobile-app-review/\">Investing apps like Acorns</a> let you link your debit or credit card and round up your purchase amounts to the nearest dollar. The change available is then available for you to invest.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Research major expenses. </strong>Any purchase over a threshold, say $100, is likely worth researching a bit to see if you can find it cheaper, on sale, or using a coupon.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"bring-in-money\">Bring in Money</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Work</strong>.<strong>\u00a0</strong>Whether it\u2019s a summer job or internship, or a part-time gig during the school year, working is a surefire way to help yourself stay within budget. <a href=\"https://uw.joinhandshake.com/login\">Look for job and internship listings in Handshake</a>, the Career & Internship Center\u2019s database. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Apply for Scholarships</strong>.\u00a0Need- and merit-based scholarships are available. <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=scholarships-101-finding-scholarships\">Look and apply for scholarships</a> that you qualify for. \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"budget-and-actively-manage-your-money\">Budget and Actively Manage Your Money</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBudgeting, the act of planning and actively reviewing what you spend, is the holy grail of finance.

To maximize both, follow these tips.", "long_body": "<p>\r\n<strong>The most important thing you can do to have a stable mood and energy is to maintain your blood sugar levels as consistent as possible</strong>. So while eating handfuls of cookies may satiate you in the moment, chances are you won\u2019t be feeling too hot in a while when your blood sugar levels drop drastically. We know that as a college student it is hard to always eat a balanced diet, but you can support body and mind by keeping your mood and energy levels steady. Here are our tips. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h4>When to Eat</h4>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Don't skip or delay meals</strong>.\u00a0Eat at least three meals a day, and be sure there is a mix of proteins and carbohydrates at every meal, especially breakfast. If you skip a meal, you may have trouble concentrating, get a headache, or feel like you didn\u2019t get very much out of class. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Schedule snacks</strong>. If you ignore your feelings of hunger, you may end up eating too much or choosing an unhealthy snack. Don\u2019t let yourself get too hungry and you\u2019ll more easily avoid mood swings. Ideally, eat something healthy every four to five hours to keep your blood sugar stable. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Enjoy your food and stop eating before you\u2019re full</strong>.\u00a0Don\u2019t deny yourself food if you are craving it, but try not to over indulge either. Eat slowly.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t \u201cstress eat.\u201d</strong> It can be easy to find yourself reaching for junk food when you are stressed out. But unfortunately, eating doesn\u2019t make stress go away. Instead, try other ways of managing stress like exercise or a mindfulness practice.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<h4>What to Eat and Drink</h4>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFoods that are high in fiber (veggies, fruits, and whole grains), and a combination of protein and carbohydrates can help slow digestion and help maintain healthy blood sugar levels, notes Jeannie Gazzaniga-Moloo, PhD, RD, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. Here\u2019s how you can accomplish that.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Fill 3/4 of your plate with produce, legumes, and whole grains</strong>. Leave only a quarter of your plate for meat, poultry, or other protein sources. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Eat a rainbow of fruits and veggies.</strong> Go for variety of color to get a range of nutrients. Include green, orange, red, blue/purple, and yellow vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Choose healthy snacks, preferably including protein.</strong>\u00a0Snack on some of these options: nuts, carrot and celery sticks, ready-to-eat whole grain cereals, brown rice cakes with nut butter, or fruit and string cheese. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong>. Drink plenty of water. And choose seltzer water over soda or fruit juice.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<h4>What to Limit</h4>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Limit sugary foods and refined grains.</strong>\u00a0Sodas, candy, white bread, and many baked goods and pastas can cause big spikes and then drops in your blood sugar levels. This can cause tiredness, irritability, and in the long term, weight gain. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Limit highly processed foods</strong>. If you can\u2019t understand the ingredients, that\u2019s a sign that something has been highly processed. This is usually true with things like hot dogs, margarine, ice cream, candy, and many packaged snack foods. These food-like substances won\u2019t provide you with many of the nutrients you need, nor do they provide the fiber you need to keep blood sugar levels stable.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Limit alcohol and caffeine</strong>. Alcohol, while fun at first, is a depressant; caffeine, similarly can interfere with your mood. Both of these substances tend to interrupt healthy sleep habits, which is key for keeping your mood and energy stable, and your mind bright! \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nAs with all things, practice moderation and find a balance that is sustainable for you. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h4>Eating Disorders</h4>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you think you or someone you know may have an eating disorder know that you can get help on campus. <a href=\"https://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/health-resource/eating-disorders/\">Learn more and get help at Hall Health Center</a>.\r\n</p>", "image": "hx_toolkit_images/Eating_Better_Mood_Energy.jpg", "image_credit": "Nicole Pasia", "image_alt_text": "", "category": 3, "slug": "eating-better-mood-and-energy", "phase": "C", "quarter": "winter", "week": 6, "related_articles": [9, 83], "related_links": []}}, {"model": "hx_toolkit.article", "pk": 83, "fields": {"title": "Hacks for Better Eating Habits", "short_body": "You don't need to make HUGE changes to eat healthier...use these 7 tips for healthy habit changes.", "long_body": "<p>\r\nWe are creatures of habit and convenience. If chips and soda are nearby, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll eat. So you may have to outsmart your inner monkey and make changes that make not-so-healthy impulses harder to act on, and make healthy actions the easy choice. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Making Healthy the Easy Choice</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Start by adding healthy food</strong>. Rather than just taking away unhealthy foods, start by focusing on healthy foods to add. Getting proper nutrition will make it easier to later cut out unhealthy foods. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Stock healthful food</strong>.<strong> </strong>Set yourself up for success by having healthy stuff on hand, and make sure you always have a healthy snack in your bag like trail mix or fruit. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Carry a water bottle</strong>. Keep a water bottle in your backpack for refilling. Seeing it will also serve as a reminder to drink water.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Start with a smaller portion</strong>.\u00a0Restaurants and dining halls tend to offer more than one serving size. Try starting small and going back for more if you\u2019re hungry, or if the portions are large plan on taking some home or splitting a meal with a friend.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Put snacks on a plate</strong>. You don't really intend to eat the whole bag chips, right? Put some on a plate instead of eating straight from a big container. Using a plate makes it easier to see how much you are eating, helps you become aware of the mindless urge to keep chewing, and ultimately helps you better regulate your portion sizes. \r\n\r\n<li><strong>Eat your meals with others</strong>.\u00a0When you can, relax and enjoy a meal with someone. This will help you eat at a reasonable pace.\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Make small lifestyle changes</strong>.\u00a0It is important to make changes that you can keep doing over time, such as adding more veggies to your diet, drinking more water, and using plates when you snack, rather than sweeping changes that are harder to sustain (like cutting all sugar).\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can further your food game by reading our article on how <a href=\"/husky_experience_message?article=eating-better-mood-and-energy\">what you eat affects your mood and your cognitive abilities</a> and following the tips there.
